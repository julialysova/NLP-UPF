Song:   Is It Love
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Angela McCluskey] + (Kendrick Lamar)
Sit still and close your eyes (smoke to it)
What's behind the other door? Oh-ohh
No more silence (no more silence)
Don't kill this thing we got called love (don't shoot)
Just searching for the perfect shot

[Chorus: Angela McCluskey]
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Kendrick Lamar] + (Angela McCluskey)
I used to write rhymes all day and all night
When y'all was playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
My conscience only knew what's half-tight
At 3:14, it's time to get me a slice my nigga
This is a dog's fight my nigga
The soundtrack to life my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
He watched House Party and ate Apple Jacks
He sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
Punk fake, jump-shot, ball hit the back
Ball dreams of being point guard was off limits Jack
That's because these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Part of me though, I'm searching for answers (just searching for the perfect shot)
The good kid from the ugly city that's mad that he's had some
Where is the love?

[Chorus: Angela McCluskey] + (Kendrick Lamar)
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away (where is the love?)
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Kendrick Lamar] + (Angela McCluskey)
Give me rings, give me chains mayne
Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range
Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
A mansion with marble floors and security codes
Then give me some landa, or maybe I'll land a
G5, clear port, say hello to the man
Give me awards, Grammies, and let the crowd applaud
my name till they strain the veins in they vocal chords
Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses
With that being said, give me Tiger's sports endorsements
Give me billboards, whatever that people would kill for
Manhattan at 40/40, no forties but rose poured
Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters' cameras be
Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts (just searching for the perfect shot)
And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar
This is me, and that's love

[Chorus: Angela McCluskey]
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody smoke to it
for this is, the celebration</pre>

Album:  Kendrick Lamar EP
Song:   Celebration
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
Ayyy, uh
For the record, I used to do a lot of humping when I was little
Got a lot of womans over that shit too
and that's random, but so what? Ha-ha-ha

Give me that beat fool, this a full-time jack
No, really this a Sounwave track
So really I ain't gotta steal nothing, all I gotta do is kill it
when you press record button, let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full-time swag
and the critics thought they had me, nah
I just bought more batteries, turned up, supercharged
A medium away from living large
Matter of fact, where my niggas at?
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi-pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one
I'm on one, I'll make sure your kids breathe pneumonia
Good kid, mad city, evil in my heart
from the blood niggas fucking with me, crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate
it's a legitimate reason why
I put on repeat Kanye's "Touch the Sky"
But I'm looking past that, I'm tryna touch God
My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
Y'all married to the game? Well I'm bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you going through something, this is shit you recite
This is bigger than life, this is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on {?}, I mean war, like that
Yeah, straight like that

[Chorus]
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me (one time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (two times)
Oh, oh, oh

[Kendrick Lamar]
Ayyy, uh, in 2010 I'm tryna ball nigga
like shooting jump shots in the mall nigga
That's a quote from Ab-Soul, I suppose
since you laughed it's the ultimate goal
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate, shall stay anonymous
Search the seven continents, accomplishing big shit
Big ass, big tits, she on me
and just to get to me she'll fuck the homies, homie's homies
The life of a cool nigga
My nigga Tony said just do you nigga, show and prove nigga
And they gon' play you for a fool, that's for sho'
till they know you got the stankiest stew nigga
Shit, I ain't tripping, I'm just tipping on fo'-fo's
Back in the city and tipping on fo' hoes
That boy got a cold cold, he's sick on, slick on
Drop red jewels like a school of Bar Mitzvahs
Oooh, straight like that

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, why y'all complain about OGs?
I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
Not Snoop, not Dre, not Ice Cube
I don't care me and Quik went to the same school
I look in the mirror and do it myself
like a self-made nigga, I don't need a maid nigga
Do I need a cosign from Dre or Jigga?
They can make me much bigger, but do I need 'em though?
I just need a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen 'Pac ghost
"Me Against the World" on you muh'fuckers
I've got my back against the wall
and the .45 draw get +smoked+, Chris Tucker
Uhh, tryna record my steelo
even when I'm not there just like TiVo
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
and weed move slow right now but E go
You know what I'm talking bout? I look at your Audemars
Then put y'all on +time+ out, it's time to unveil the real
and your career's bout as frail as Ms. Winehouse
Just salute, grab a flute and pull the wine out
Oooh, just like that

[Chorus]</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
Well alright

[Chorus 2X: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life
where pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice

[Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, they rushed us then, I had no job
Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association, story of my life nigga~!
You gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga~!
Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears, I tried my best, let it go, trench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin
Maintaining my modest-modest as I dream
So while I go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call it
Life itself, I know it helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry

[Chorus 2X]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I said, keep reading my diary when my life's entirely
surrounded by the irony of living in the city
I said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beat
and the only thing can help is ass and some titties
So what's up baby? I said what's up?
I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
See I ain't tryna think about no phone bills, credit card late fees
Capital One popping up on my caller I.D.
Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow tip shots
Watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
Man, that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear?
You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
Or run through a pothole at two in the morning
Scared to hit your emergencies, cause then they'll be on it
See I know, when the harsh reality takes toll
Open up your contacts, then scroll ("hey what's up daddy?")

[Chorus 2X]

[Ab-Soul]
Welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve
Cutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd
like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtleneck
Convertibles with turbo jets fueled by 7 Up and Prometh'
I feel like death's around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
So I took another shot, tequila hit me like a nina (blaow~!)
My sky's gray, my bitch is brighter
Always saying "Lights Please", J. Cole's her ghostwriter
And I'm the God MC, join my diocese
Free ya mind, don't mind so-ciety
And finally, everyone got their own problems
Everything's subject to change like broken dollars
I'ma, drown in my drink and swim in my woman's vagina
like a Pirahna fin, it gets harder than Rihanna when

[Chorus 2X]

Album:  Kendrick Lamar EP
Song:   She Needs Me
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
One time
Reporting live, Compton, California

She go to work, she go to school
Her body smooth, no tattoos
Type of girl that make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too, she's compatible
She's independent, she handle her business
She believe in God and no other religions
Never in competition when it comes to her friends
She's dependable, she set her own trends
A confidant, a mediator
So sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her, doing you a favor
Look at her hips, I want to be her pager
Conservative, affirmative
Action when she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man could see
A true queen, and she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God a blind man could see
A true queen, and she needs me

[Chorus: Javonte]
That girl is smoking
and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
and together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on

[Kendrick Lamar]
Five years later, an accounting major
Work at a firm, abundance of paper
She got a career, she look in the rear-
view mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
Private bars, executive meetings
Consecutive trips, vacation on weekends
Dior reeking through her Prada dress
Probably the only product of a pure success
Got a promotion, now she own the building
Headed to the top like she on the building
Real estate, property
She do tender steak, only one mouth to feed
Funded a youth center, invested in some stock
Doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
Oh what a girl, how great life can be
and though she got the world, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be
and though she got the world, she needs me

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
We lose touch, separated
Years pass, I'm out dating
She's dating, one of Hollywood's
famous of entertainers, Denzel good
Paparazzi spot 'em out shopping
Tuesday morning brunch, Benihana's
Tabloids paint the picture of a perfect couple
Headline reads, when a famous actor loves you
Emmy Awards, Academy too
On the red carpet, dress matching his suit
She holding his arm, she wave at her moms
then wave at the world, got the world in her palms
Head in the clouds, star-gazing
Caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
He bent down, got on one knee
She looked him in the eye, and said she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
Even if we seem to separate, eventually
it'll come to pass, and she'll need me
I need her... we need we

[Chorus]</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
See y'all don't understand me
My plan be is to win y'all hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that young boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
the way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
from the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn that boy good
+Bright+ as Thomas Edison, but Gucci Mane hood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here
You can shoot shots or cheer cause I... am</pre>

Song:   Wanna Be Heard
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, y'know?
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers
I'm the oldest, nigga
And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Check it out

I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z
until I finally realised that Jay wasn't me
I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
because I used to practice early morning and then after school
I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you
But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
I'ma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
as an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focussed
In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
That shit's embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
and admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo'
My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
But he always questioned when I'ma drop my debut CD
How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga
At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga
It's a sacrifice I try to tell him
That's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous
of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
I ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
I just wanna hear you heard

[Chorus]
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (man I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I re-up, cooking up all day
like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

[Kendrick Lamar]
What up Dasan? I ain't forgot nigga
You developed me, telling me I was hot nigga
You believed in me first, that's what's for sure
At the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion
A lot was going on in your life and you needed space
But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened
But I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay away
And I wrong, I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd done
But I'm telling you we ain't done
Matter of fact, how's your sons? What they up to?
Remember they used to run around while you had worked on ProTools?
People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning
with school in the morning, yawning, but I was on it
Me, you and Dave was on it
Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped
Where them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rocked
Time to be heard

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
So can you feel it?
When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
Do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing
Word to Spike Lee, don't he look like Sounwave?
That's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays, like a dog in the night
Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
to grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
I spread love like a Hippy, but I'm a +Black+ one
with Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bible
Tabernacle to all my rivals, I ain't mad
You hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad
because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas
I probably can't heal cancer, but I can heal the city
My niggas, tell me you with me
And if you is won't you pop my CD in
Open up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heard
Yeah, uh huh

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
D-Dave, what up nigga?
Matt Jeezy {*laughs*}</pre>

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I used to to wanna by like Michael Jordan
Figured that I'd hit the NBA and make a fortune
Thank God for these rap recordings
I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
5-0-1s, Louis letterman jacket
Little brother only five, momma put him on my taxes
You know that Compton ghetto shit
that every Section 8 tenant is familiar with? Ooh wee
They say he something like the seventies, but I'm from '87
With a thousand dimes, you got eighty sevens
Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
Fucking all my high school teachers, that was '05 bro
And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
The fuck I look like?
A billion bucks, and that's why

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Kendrick Lamar]
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it, hoe
Uh, so give me fifty feet champ
Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp
I'm in the hot spot, I know they seats damp
And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
You Nix Check Cashing
I'm GT crashing, 1-0-5 off ramp
Ay, that lil' nigga got it going on
G5, going-going-going gone
Cloud nine mind state
I drop a record, then I raise the crime rate
Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie?
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck, skip to Y

[Chorus 2]

[Jay Rock]
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
Say she on birth control, no I don't trust it
Aooow~! First off, I'm a rider bitch
Put them twenty-sixes on a Silverado bitch
I keep my bitch with a finer bitch
Snap my fingers, she'll go and find a bitch
Tell them fuck boys that I do this
Got the best product round town, Frank Lucas
Confuse 'em like a Rubix cube when I roll up
Okay, Subway bread like some cold cuts
And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy
Wild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti
Fuck you, pay me, paper over pussy nigga
When I drop, you ain't getting paper nor pussy nigga

[Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this</pre>

Song:   Uncle Bobby & Jason Keaton
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
I was sitting on the couch, reading yellow paper
A letter in reply, seven days later
after I wrote him "stay strong, keep your faith in God"
what I told him, hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
as the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being twenty-one
Doing time in the pen and your gramp's old
Your brother's getting older, and the streets is getting colder
and you're hoping that he's focussed to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been thirty weeks
Ain't received any mail, it's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine, yeah

[Chorus: Javonte]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

[Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
after he just got out, fifteen years to count
Haven't seen the world in so long, haven't seen a girl in so long
and before the sun came up, he was gone
like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together, or whatnot
Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
Found a job, found his mother gravesite, found a forty ounce
Then he found God, then he bounced
Then he found a new chick, two kids, wide hips
Found something in her we didn't see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shacked with her, an investment
Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
Only out a year, now facing life, I can only imagine
That's fucked up, I can only imagine, Uncle Bob

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting on the couch, thinking bout the ratio
of blacks in prison, it's compact in prison
when blacks packed with minorities, system grab more of these
eighteen-year-olds, eighteen-year sentence
with no parole, the state won't oversee
They make the term severe, a conspiracy
That's what I call it, it's full of shit, a toilet can help quick
The government help? No, just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there, yeah, it's justice for all
But ninety-percent unfair, care? Nah
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man for five grand
with intentions to expand, more prisons
So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business, imagine
We being used, imagine, the truth shall be told

[Chorus]</pre>

Album:  Kendrick Lamar EP
Song:   Faith
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
Cloud nine, Kendrick Lamar, uh
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I started questioning God, what is my purpose?
He say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up man, I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do? Gotta have faith
Life is too much, understood? Where is your faith?
Oh, faaaaaaaith...
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Kendrick Lamar]
Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't bout shit, that nigga ain't bout shit
Spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature
and maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice
that said the Devil is a lie, make a better choice
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
with them crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her section 8
Then lost her faith again

[Chorus]

[Punch]
Kendrick, I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
This about how faith works, yeah, murk it... 
I had dreams of holding a nine-milla to Ray's killer
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's a jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rat's lurking, vulture's circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
to make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach cloud nine, that's what my niggas bout
But it never rain in California 'less them pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Ray Charles voice

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering is there really a God?
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
But whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
and wonder why I ain't never caught that feeling before
Maybe they know him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know is that he's real and he lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because he's testing your faith again

I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
than die and find out there really is, think about it</pre>

Song:   Trip
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

"Boarding completed
 I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
 Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
 and we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet
 At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
 Relax and breathe normally"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, coming down like I'm uphill
Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort
Ha-ha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson

[Chorus]
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
cause I'm a trip

[Kendrick Lamar]
Landing on another runway, fly with me
or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on
like we never been off, straight shots of Patron
I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches
Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those
And she know what this is, hey lil' mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama
But why you always in somebody face lil' mama?
Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage +Lil Mama+
Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
If I ain't, I gotta be that nigga
Curtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage
or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
on some Compton shit
Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping
The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan
I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain coming
So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothing

[Chorus]

"How was your flight Mr. Lamar?
 Good, hope to see you next time"</pre>

Song:   Vanity Slaves
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh-uh-uh, what up?
Uh, I'm tryna, what up?
Uh-uh, I'm tryna get something
Uh-uh-uh, I'm tryna, what up?
I say, what up?
Uh-uh, I'm tryna

Sometimes I wanna leave, sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I wanna lie
Sometimes I wanna school the youth, sometimes I wanna ride
Sometimes I wanna not think, sometimes I wanna vibe
Sometimes I wanna bump Tribe and zone out, this song bout a young boy
that's going wild inside, when my world collide
with your world where your girl and your kids reside
We kill the facades, we feel free to fly
We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much, if my clothes is new
if my ride is plush, if my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
so she can be cool to be amongst popularity
The various name brands that reach the price scan
that's not about the right price, but more like the right scam
to rule us all, confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now let's draw the picture of a rapper with a chain
in a Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
that lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward? Then I rewind
A time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are, farther you from the white man's home
Negro spiritual zones gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity they parted our families
They put us in hundred-degree shade, and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules
and trapped our minds in the cage, our freedom was so fake
Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross, uh~!
And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
and a smirk could get you hurt, wound diversed from a scar
Four-hundred years of nothing, four-hundred years of suffering
Four-hundred years of tears and tribulation, miseducation
See what we facing is now coming, back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot?
Call us niggers and figured that we'd never lived in pursuit
of happiness, we captured these feelings in things that we do
Thought it's abstinence in slavery, but we made it come to
a modern perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her handbag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she foobie
She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though
We filling up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to twenty-sixes, out there riding Kobes
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya
he overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw
The reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss
Slaves

Uh, I say the four-hundred years we never had nothing
Barely had clothes on our back
It's the reason why when we get a little bit of change
we over-exaggerate on our living expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
You're a vanity slave
If you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger
four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
You're a vanity slave
If you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fo's on it
and on the back of the window it says "get on my level hoe"
You're a vanity slave
We all vanity slaves
and with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
I'm not from around here
Hey Ali, where we at? Idaho?
Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month
You know them checks come in
I'm tryna get something, but what up?</pre>

Album:  Kendrick Lamar EP
Song:   Far From Here
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar - singing]
A nigga so goddamn stressed out
I feel like fuck everything right now
See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
But I'll be damned if I give 'em a handout
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye
If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried
What? Uh

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

[Kendrick Lamar - singing]
It seems like, you can't win for losing
Whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?"
Sitting pursuing, but your time will soon come
Nobody knows the position that you in
But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
That feeling, hard to explain
When you just, just want to get away
Something like

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Schoolboy Q]
Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
I'm stuck on the studio couch, now I'm thinking bout my daughter
Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order
instead of problem solving
From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
as I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
Nothing is surrounding me, living my life
Though it's better to write
Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real
A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar

[Chorus 2]</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Rapper Big Pooh
Album:  Kendrick Lamar EP
Song:   Thanksgiving
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
Reporting live, from Compton, California
North Cackalack

Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, no Audemars on my wrist
Just arthritis from holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
I'm busy taking over, the world
with the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
to hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
with offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, boo-yaa, no one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Caddilac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down
like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite
All I ask, open your ears and please savor it
The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired
I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired
Now I'm brushing off the dust
We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk
People hear his pain, I consider that a plus
I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing, consider me the in-between
The new regime taking over
Either we each other's opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
off to the next, you unlucky bastard
I'm getting drunk same time every year
to celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here
I swear

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
even Zeus can beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet
I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the
city like a District Attorney being the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers 

[Rapper Big Pooh]
U-P-S, I +deliver+
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter, all guts, no glory
Station on repeat, they retread the same story
New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit
Have a plate, that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real Hip-
Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped

[Chorus]</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Kendrick Lamar EP
Song:   Let Me Be Me
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
We on Ali? You ugly
Everybody just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me you're real
Middle fingers up

[Chorus]
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
(That's the only way I know how to hold it down
 That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
but I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror, then realize
that real lies, within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather two-step like my first steps
Jill Scott in my iPod as my head rests, yes

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali'
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha-ha-ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Stale face, play me short like an Oompa-Loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killers man, people who killed man
But my character never could be like them man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man
Live my life through some film man?
I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows
cause they know they'll know Kendrick fo' sho', and oh

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photo book to remember me
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killers, chasing hits
Lying to yourself all over an image
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
My mama said, boy that don't sound like you
I said, this is the sound though, my only excuse
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
and kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter
Watching Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life to mix it up in a blender
to make sure that you feel it

[Chorus]

[uncredited female]
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Is this really you? Is this who you are?
What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Who are you?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?

[Kendrick Lamar]
I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to want to be the messiah of rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
that I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
That means I'll be fronting, hmm
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
that the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I'm misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dame said he proud of my newfound honesty
and all I could say is, will the radio care?
Yeah, or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my Hip Hop when I was sixteen years old
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
Twenty-two like the smallest of guns that you know, most determined
but with the smallest of funds to show, but I'm not worried
My talent should take me places I've never been
The world should turn soon as my record spin
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
Too focussed, one word, righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar
and soon y'all know cloud nine y'all
And that means I wanna be the highest
Too focussed, one word (righteous)
Mm, yeah
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focussed, one word

[uncredited female]
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
Too focussed, one word
Too focussed, too focussed, one word</pre>

Song:   Determined *

* bonus track

[Intro: Napoleon Hill]
"I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible
 because it will reveal to you why it is true
 that whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve
 regardless of how many times you have failed in the past
 or how lofty your aims and hopes may be"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Go getter, with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
that don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself
then bubble like the ass of Buffy when she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Take your time, it'll come
Just stay focussed and humble my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who's dope, it's who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Kendrick Lamar]
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and start blasting?
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Hear a hustle from a nigga that's constantly bragging
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop five bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
Area, or carry the birds to the gate
Let the clips distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks, flip three-to-six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a Trump
Donald that is

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar - over chorus]
And when I do it, I do it again, then I go back
When I do it, I'll do it again, then I go back
Thug it out, but for now I'm willing to dug it out
I gotta grind, grind

[Kendrick Lamar]
So welcome to the story of my life
See I'm tryna get right off the shit that I write
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and the wife
Pop's engine in this old school run tight~!
But as you listening to K. D-O-T
Me and my girl split the bucket at KFC
She listening to Drake and all I can say
Damn, these niggas that much better than me?
Baby, I don't think this is meant to be
cause I'm always losing self-esteem
She paused the iPhone, then said huh
I repeated what I said, then she replied shut up
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones
Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I gotta see success
I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Rising to the top like a soda shook up
Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar - over chorus]
Yeah, I swear to God I don't wanna do it, just live man
I wanna live good
Just wanna make my momma proud, y'know?
I don't wanna be hard, I don't want the most stripes
I got lil' brothers and sisters man, I'm the oldest nigga
I just want it, I just want it
and I'ma get it</pre>

Album:  Overly Dedicated *
Song:   The Heart Pt. 2

* only featured on the free download version

[Intro: excerpt from interview with Dash Snow]
I'll tell you what I don't believe in, can I do that?
Alright, I don't believe in the, in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever
I try not to obey them at any time
That's what I believe in, not believing in
(So what keeps you alive?)
Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds and
uh, what keeps me alive? Shit, um
Music, I have to listen to music all day long
I'd say that keeps me going
I'm a pretty dark person, I've thought about ending it a million times
and I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing

[Kendrick Lamar]
Thank you
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
And still I come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts
and Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect
I ain't seen too many churches or know them Testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
or end up dead, die trying and know death
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art is all I have, and victory tastes sweet
even when an enemy can throw salt
Still knock 'em out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from
we buy guns and more guns to give to the young
I'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga
inside the system, all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison, he wasn't wrapped too tight
He told me rap about life, not rap, niggas
That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap dissing
My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating, then my final intuition
is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Compton, lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap Saran our defiance, ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands of the black man
One hood with twenty fo'-fo's like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I "Wanna Be Heard" and wonder who I am
You probably even listened to "Faith" and think I know Zion
But really I'm just caught in the loop of understanding the truth
because it seem like it's always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice, I ain't lying
I swear to God, half of y'all cats just don't know Kendrick
The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eyewitness
You just mind your bidness
You just turn your head, kneel down, and then tie your tennis
It's kinda scary ain't it
You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain it, why you pick up that stainless?
Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you when you hated him
so much, you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
Said if you'd see him on them bleachers then you'd kill him, facing
twenty-five to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey, and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if my record never break I still won't break my promise, I promise to keep it honest
Secret society, all we ask is trust
and all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And I'm like, the Kendrick Lamar O.D. in less than a month
Alright? Gotta keep it pushing
Can't let the government tell me how my future looking
I'm on Rosecrans & Central tryna duck the central bookings
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bucking, never will I surrender
I've been a warrior when I came out of my mom's placenta
In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter
How splendid, I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
They said seven tracks, I said fifteen
Called it an EP, they said I'm tripping
But little did they know, I'm tryna change the rules
that we've been confined to, so the corporate won't make decisions
Uppity bitches, handling bidness
Killing our dreams, stealing our vision
Out in Haiti adolescents barely have a home
In L.A. everybody think they fucking on
Hop on Twitter, perpetrate, we doing big shit
Who we hanging with, and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God, most of y'all cats just don't know Kendrick
You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended
Ain't doing this for my health, I'm tryna purchase my momma them Benzes
Occupy my time with riches, justify my time, ambition's
just to coincide, just to go inside books we idolize while we living
Look the mastermind, took the master's mind, just the perfect time just to master mine
Just to master grind with precision, look the mastermind, took the... {*coughs*}

[Outro: Alori Joh]
We would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP
For this is the Kendrick Lamar O.D.
Because of you, we are Overly Dedicated</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Jhene Aiko
Album:  Overly Dedicated
Song:   Growing Apart (From Everything)
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now

[Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
That's what she said to me
That place I used to call home is just a bed to me
and we don't even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I'm in these streets with everybody
I'm trying to get it and she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don't reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
That's what it said to me
But that place I call ambition now dead to me
Gone and forgotten, I'm off track like Dale Earnhardt
My liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls
Balling out, but I'm bout to drop the ball
I'm calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio, I wanna tell him nah

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
That's what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven unfair to me
Only a hundred and forty-four can go
Seven billion people on planet earth today
Is there something that I don't know?
I know to follow him, rather following people
or follow vanity cause that means I'm following evil
Guess I'm following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need, but live like I don't need you

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
So in conclusion
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what's important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focussed and sanctified
We all get distracted
The question is, would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action? It's just a part of life
And if your vision's impaired, you probably lose it all tonight

[Jhene Aiko]
I'm trying to visualize how to get it right
But my vision's so blurry
Trying to slow it down, stay close to the ground
But we're always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world stand a little slower
Then I would, then we could grow a little closer
I think we're getting closer
I think we're getting closer</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
I remember, uh
All my uncles, Sir Smokers
on Alondra, in front of our building
They was my heroes

[Chorus]
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crackheads
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and that's scary to me
Dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
Especially when Sounwave is on his Ps
Nigga cue me in, I'm a Peruvian drug lord
Don't fast forward, I'ma serve you some +keys+
This is crack cocaine, I'm Kurt Cobain
and I bang like a C-R-I-P
P-I-R-U, high you, I'm an I-V
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crack... stop
I said an I-V cause when I be
in the studio, I shot a needle in your vein
Take it in vain or itch till your eyeballs pop
I'm cold on a cold turkey, I hate chickens
but I do fuck pretty birdies, where your girl at?
Over the Pyrex where my world at

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and that's scary to me
Every listener is a strawberry to me
You pussies ain't shit but venereal disease
Zs on K. Dot? Uh uh, better wake up
A nightmare, I'm right there like a Siamese
twin, when you motherfuckers gon' learn?
Curl up like Big Worm when I drop
Who fly? I'm a red eye with eyedrops
I BIG, I 'Pac, you Chris, I +Rock+
That's Pookie on +New Jack+, head-first with a cyclops
I'm the first one to do that, I bet you never knew that
Back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on?
If it ain't about me, about hoe
or be about face if you ain't on +Higher+, +Learning+
There's soda in the pot and the fire, burning

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and it's scary to carry
a smooth-type flow like a drink of Merlot
That'll freak y'all out like a girl Virgo
When I turbo on any track it's a Reynolds wrap
And I rap like a nigga who invented rap, rapping heat
You could fall to defeat if you don't pay your tolls
like the limbs on your feet, I suppose
This is bigger than life
This is probably everybody Illuminatis
Guess I'm the blood sacrifice
of the party, I undress her like a Harley
Lights will flash, cars will crash
Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
So my bad if I put you in rehab
You are reimbursed, put it on my, tab

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar - over chorus]
Aw dude, you about to fucking O.D. bro</pre>

Album:  Overly Dedicated
Song:   P&P 1.5
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Intro]
"Gina, baby, I don't have no money, and I don't have no ends
 Gina, I'm ass-out" {*laughter*}
"I'm going through something right now"
"I told you that"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
Well alright

[Chorus 2X: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life
where pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice

[Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, they rushed us then, I had no job
Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association, story of my life nigga~!
You gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga~!
Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears, I tried my best, let it go, trench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin
Maintaining my modest-modest as I dream
So while I go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call it
Life itself, I know it helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry ("hey what's up daddy?")

[Chorus 2X]

*beat switches up*

"So what you wish me over here for?
 How was your day?
 Are you tipsy?"
Mhmm

[Kendrick Lamar - screwed vocals]
All I need in this lifetime, pussy and Patron
Give me that, won't you give that? Once again it's on
Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby mama what it do
Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is
Go on poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
When you let me, when you let me...

[Kendrick Lamar - singing]
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty
That good shit stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you, blame it on the liquor babe
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty
That good shit stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you...

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home
and caught that flat in the {?} flats
And it made me think when another car blinked
to change locations where we at
We often get lost in the ever-hard bottle
when attempt to ignore pain, problem and sorrow
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
Your car now due and you bout to get evicted
Two drugs surely, Patron, pussy, make it feel alright
But once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life
You can't run from it, gotta run to it nigga
The antidote wouldn't last and you knew it nigga
But still you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign

[Chorus 2X]

[Ab-Soul]
Okay, welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, man I hate to work for them
One time I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me
And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man
What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open
Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open
'Soul, balls deep, ya dig?
Retrieve relief, ya dig?
Let's kill a bottle of tequila
and lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya?
What's up? I had a long day and I really want to fuck
Take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day
cause all I've been thinking the whole day...

[Chorus 2X]

[Kendrick Lamar - screwed vocals]
All I need in this lifetime, pussy and Patron
Give me that, won't you give that? Once again it's on
Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby mama what it do
Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is
Go on poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
When you let me, when you let me...</pre>

Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus]
She look better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D., that girl's an alien
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
U-F-O fly away
So let's go-go-go-go, let's go-go-go-go
Let's go-go-go-go, let's go, let's go

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, she got me going, I'm all in
Fifty stories, I'm falling
Where you been? Is it planet Mars?
Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?
You're unfamiliar, but still I feel ya
Energy is sending me toward the ceiling
I'm high now, are you up there?
If you was, I would climb every other stair
I gotta stare, I mean wow
and I'm wowed, no one compares
A one-on-one, you must have won
every pageant in America when you was young
Lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy
Body frame crazy, insane, crazy
The only girl that can make time, then make me stop

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, so now we on, so now we gone
Living in the city of the unknown
I show her off, I stunt with her
We do it sweet, they look bitter
Look at her get up, I hear 'em say
But why him? I hear 'em hate
I laugh at it, rather than jab at it
Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
cause I'm addicted, and you the drug
Cold turkey? No sir
Gotta be an odyssey from Heaven way above
You definite, not probably, I gotta give it up
Lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy
Body frame crazy, insane, crazy
The only girl that can make time, then make me stop

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
You something different
I'm glad I found you
So pretty
I'll never do anything to hurt you</pre>

Song:   Opposites Attract (Tomorrow, W/O Her)
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

{*female crying*}

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, yeah *3X*
Uh
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people...
I'm inspired, so get inspired

And so he said, why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
Why you couldn't be a con-artist? Why you couldn't
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
the moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
Why you let me use yours cause I don't got mines?
Why you always lift me up when I'm completely giving up?
Or when niggas holler what's up, you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last, knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me? Why you always thinking of me?
Want my company rather than going club hopping
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you, sometimes

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Javonte)
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
(Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
 nothing in common, it ain't fair
 But where do we seem to fall?
 Where do we seem to fall?
 Tender love and care, once upon a time
 Once upon a time, we was there)

[Kendrick Lamar]
And so she said, why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
out in public, curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying hi daddy?
Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don't never ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still love my ex?
Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's your favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after your homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
even though you get violent and put your hands on me? Sometimes

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lamont Carey "She Says She Loves Me"]
She says she loves me, she says she loves me
so she clings to me even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like sometimes when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
and she only gives advice, she says when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning
she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me, she says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower
she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
she says, she says she loves me
And I don't know about love</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Schoolboy Q
Album:  Overly Dedicated
Song:   Michael Jordan
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[uncredited female]
I used to want to be like Michael Jordan
Figured I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, every time I'm in my city I be hacking like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumping "Me Against the World", hello world, Kendrick here
And I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan
Bounce-bounce hoe, bounce-bounce

[Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich
Pull up on them twenty-sixes, I'm a vanity slave
I'm a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
I'm a Comp-town representer, concrete backflipper
A.K.A. that nigga, don't worry
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
This is HiiiPoWeR, since the Eddie Bower I've been popular
I'm popping now, every other hour, paparazzi come
You jocking her, let her be a hoe, why you stopping her?
We stopping the traffic, what you know bout them hockey pucks?
Skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em
Seen too many of y'all getting money, know my turn coming
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and I don't know why... "Hey, wait a minute motherfucker"

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I'm in my city I be feeling like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumping "Me Against the World", hello world, Kendrick here
And I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
That means I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes

[Kendrick Lamar]
Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?
Only thing I did wrong was make it possible
I diddy bop and make them titties pop
Out there on my bumper like a city cop
Walking out of Fred Segal, put my girl on it
Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it
Ay, pussy crazy, pussy crazy
You fuck niggas, you pussies crazy
Man, I know I can't tell you bout the world homie
But I know I can tell you bout your girl homie
Her pussy's crazy, her pussy crazy
I fucked nigga, I know you hate me
I know they pay me, too much of attention
Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned
I need me an engine that go real fast
Call it "Haul of Fame", once it haul ass
Give me tall glass, Coconut Ciroc
Please no soda pop, I make my solo pop
Life's a bitch, her pussy crazy
But I make that pussy pay me

[Chorus 2]

[Schoolboy Q]
I remember tripping, walking through the set like my Glock don't think
Grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and I don't why you sucker niggas can't see
I'm from Hoover mayne, high as Supermayne, shit you Lois Lane
You pussy mayne with the pussy game, shit we off the chain
We popping ay, fortune, not the fame, shit you backwards mayne
You chasing hoes, we replacing those, bag and pass them hoes
Your broad that chose, yes she moving on, yep we do it wrong
We fucked her holmes, fucked her, sent her home, marijuana strong
You know I'm gone, turn my swagger on, am I swagged enough?
My paper long, yep you left alone, you gets no fucks
Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts round and round
Told Mary/merry was a +go+, so we passed her +round+ and +round+
Your bitch texted me, wants it now, so I had to knock her down
Work her bouncing on my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
You let it slide, I hit home-runs, clean her dugout till I'm done
I can be her number two and you can be her number one
Her pussy's crazy, her pussy's crazy
You fuck niggas

[Chorus 2]</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
Lord, forgive me... kill him where he stand
Then stand over him, shake his hand, then jump back in that minivan
Double back to his block and blam, I ain't backing down for nothing
I'm back 'em down like Shaq' with this black .223 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single man
Police radio signal saying that a one-eighty-seven land
on your corner, coroners comfort your mama, mama he's dead, the next morning
high toasted up with my homies, we drink and smoke marijuana
Want us to change our ways? Uh huh, you see this game we play come from
uncles that raised me in Compton, ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know, I don't have conscience, I just load up and start dumping
on enemies, I'm head-hunting, no sympathy, ain't no love when
you in these streets, just get something, protect your neck cause they coming
for set respects, split your onion, then chop your deck, your head tumbling like gymnastics
cause ignorance is bliss

[Chorus]
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high

[Kendrick Lamar]
This the hardest shit you heard from L.A. this far
and I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
We all tryna ball, and when I got the rock I'll dish off
until the day I pistol whip you posers till y'all pissed off
then peel off in a hoopty, come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
and they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably I'm too street, indubitably I'ma do me better than your bitch would
But you niggas too weak, but just give me two weeks and I'm good
I'll make an album that will put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading, I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet
Cats so watered down, clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around they neck and watch 'em panic
Give me respect damn it, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents, apparently you a parrot
Mocking me and my blueprint, but I won't share it
Just make you +cop+ it, then call you a sheriff, stop it
I'm hearing the comments, the critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be calling me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common
proves that ignorance is bliss

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And this still the hardest shit you've heard from L.A. this far
and I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
It's my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
and they wonder why these California earthquakes hitting so hard
I'm SoCal, you so-called, rappers need to go call
Ghostbusters to shoot busters, I'm Casper when I go off
I show up to show out and show off, you a hundred percent behind me
And if you hard then wreck your car, then walk up to my crime scene
I remember being seventeen wishing someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backing down bargains, backing down bitches
We gon' flip her when she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her
cause ignorance is bliss
And Willie B, I'm a fool on your beats
I bleed out the speaker as the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6

Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
like should I start trapping? If what I write down
don't connect this very moment, then I'm on it, no question
In the streets my niggas is well connected, let's see
Do I cop a pound of kush, Promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots chopping the rocks like flintstone feet
This is me frustrated, battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work, across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
and hope one day it flourish to a kilo, track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle, making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga, what you doing on these corners with me?
"I thought you had a show?" Well I guess my nigga, I didn't
I'm tryna get this dough and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines
Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up
Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution
Curve-serving, know I might be in your store boosting
two-elevens with MAC-11s like fuck Hip Hop
Don't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be 'Pac
Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got
or everything getting shot, for nothing
Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
Then expand to the Hoover dam, water
Sherm, contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down
and pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
you'll know I always had a passion for riddle when writing
But lately I've been thinking bout taking chances to brighten
my future financially, so please don't be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit
So I tell my nigga front me, let me put it on the strip
Then give it back when I think about the consequence, shit

[BJ the Chicago Kid]
There are times, when you need someone
I will be by your side
Oh darling, cause there is a light that shines
special for you, and me yeah
I-take-I-take-take my chances-chances-chances
before they pass, they pass, they pass
Pass me by, oh darling
You've got to look at the other side

[Kendrick Lamar]

[Kendrick Lamar]
One time
Reporting live, Compton, California

Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never get right? Sort of like a black sheep
Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the win but you never win the track meet
Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter
and life's a bitch, don't hit women so I bit her
I struck enough pain, let her know I wasn't playing
I was so +Sincere+ like Nas' first name
in Belly, they'd tell me, it's very difficult to see twenty-five
and if I survive I probably wouldn't sell it
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
in the ghetto, rather in some heals like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets
for filling voids of broke D-boys selling weed
Fucking up my prestige, till I live with the blues
B.B. King or the neighbors of Snoop

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Ash Riser) + {uncredited female}
That's why I'm in the club like fuck it though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
(Through the barbed wire)
{We are, we are fighters
 We are, we are true
 Through the, through barbed wires
 We will, will break through}
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
(Through the barbed wire)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right? Sort of like a black sheep
Tryna get away from the world stereotype
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny
She desperately in need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
She gon' have a baby, then flee from her education
At the age of sixteen, credit card scam schemes
See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
She will never get by, no how, no way
Welfare recipient, property of the state
Housing, Section 8, corner store, prostitute
The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she cute
Hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
and this baby daddy is new to the family
Chilling in pajamies, waiting on the first
Fast-forward, spilling drinks on her fur

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Ash Riser) + {uncredited female}
That's why she in the club like fuck it though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say she can't live comfortable
She gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while she up in V.I.P. pouring Merlot in her glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
(Through the barbed wire)
{We are, we are fighters
 We are, we are true
 Through the, through barbed wires
 We will, will break through}
So while she up in V.I.P. pouring Merlot in her glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
(Through the barbed wire)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Have you ever felt like you finally got life?
You finally got right? No longer a black sheep
Living off your +dreams+ like Christina uh-Milian in the front seat
of a convertible, eloping to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
It's like you just hit the lottery, my God
There must be a God, cause golly
you done made it through the fight while squabbling, Ali
Now your lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cops
and you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
Making good decisions, got an independent business mind
And both of y'all are steady grinding, doing it the legal way
Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Ash Riser)
In the club like fuck it though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say they can't live comfortable
They gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So even if you overcame doubt and your living ain't bad
Know it's some barbed wire that's always in your path
(Through the barbed wire)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Just laugh, then everybody say

[Ash Riser]
Cause I won't get caught again
and I'm here to start the trend
You can't catch me if you try
Disappear into the night, and I'm gone

[Outro]
"So you made it past all the barbed wires?"
Just one more left {*gun shot*}</pre>

The hardest thing for me to do
is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
on the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either crip or piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
and I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
my momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
they'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and..., real talk, and

[Chorus]
This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, y'know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

[Kendrick Lamar]
I was walking from Centennial
when an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hold up
Where you from? "I don't bang"
Where you stay? "Westside", that's a piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed to cross Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the hot ninety-five, they said they already knew
what happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but

[Chorus]
This is why they fuck with me (I told you nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

[Kendrick Lamar]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
in Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
and land in the land of the AKs
and the minivans where the fan never on
cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, y'know?

[Chorus]
This is why they fuck with me {*laughs*}
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

[Kendrick Lamar]
So there you have it
But I'ma leave you with this
An O.G. once told me
a real gangster is either dead or in jail
or behind the scenes getting real money
I'm gone</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Overly Dedicated
Song:   H.O.C
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
H.O.C., H.O.C.
All the real smokers give me H.O.C.
All the real smokers give me H.O.C.
H.O.C., H.O.C.
All the real smokers give me H.O.C.
H.O.C.

Everybody know I spit that hunk of shit
Shit that make you duck for cover shit
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
Especially when Drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
Jump in the booth, then shatter every rapper's dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
That's a jab, you should bob and weave
like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
You telling me the kush make you think on level four?
I'm on five, you saying I can level more?
In high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
creation of man and Columbine

[Chorus]
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your endo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look, nowadays everybody think they big chiefers
just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
They new booties, they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over your city for forty days
forty nights, off the chain like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted like forty gays
My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
Those the type of lines that I'm talking bout
You know, the type of rhymes you don't talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
so my mama can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me like my son's bout to win
Somehow, someday, and I don't care when
I might hit the gin once a month
I'll let you inhale/in hell, like an atheist

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh, I'll take you back to the ninth grade
when Dough Boy had me high for four days
That's my nigga, he a street nigga
Probably in your hood fucking up your street nigga
But anyway, I think it was some purple
Told me don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you
I didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade
Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fucking monster
I'm Frankenstein every time this motherfucker ponders
Just underline every letter
Capital K-D-O-T, letting it flat out
like a tire with slow leaks, and what you bout?
Nothing huh? Am I square cause I don't puff a square?
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar *screwed*]
H.O.C., H.O.C.
All the real smokers give me H.O.C.
All the real smokers give me H.O.C. (Bitch I'm blowed~!)
H.O.C., H.O.C. (Bitch I'm blowed~!)
All the real smokers give me H.O.C.
All the real smokers give me H.O.C.

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh, uh
Ali, you thirsty on Twitter {*laughs*}
You boo-boo, you T
You turned down, you thirsty
You boo-boo

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings
and if I speak the good into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like, and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney & Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
to the car she drove last year, or who fucking on who
and who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch, I'ma cut you off

[Chorus]
Cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... hoe
Every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
or at least inquire similar desires
to do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making enemies my nigga
Oh, that's not your memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
on how much you well connected like centipedes my nigga?
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed him at the Monte Crystal
Where so-and-so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on something with some substance that can get us both paid
rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off

[Chorus]
Cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... scary ass
Every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa, studying art
Now paint that picture, life behind bars
Remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed, them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For fifteen years no one paid, him attention but moms
Yeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people, dang
And if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would probably cut y'all off, too, yep

[Chorus]
Cause every time you come around y'all be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... keep it running Ali
Every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say

[Kendrick Lamar]
So tell 'em shut the fuck up
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
Yeah bitch you boo-boo, you T
You turned down, you thirsty
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
Yeah nigga you boo-boo, you T
You turned down, you thirsty
You thirsty, you boo-boo
You T, you turned down
You boo-boo, you T
You boo-boo, you turned down
You thirsty, you T
You boo-boo, you turned down
You boo-boo, you T
You turned down, you weak
You weak, yo' bitch weak
Yeah {*laughs*}
You boo-boo, you T {*laughs*}
Keep all that

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See it's known today that the human race is nothing
No moral, no standards
What we're about to do is raise the level of expectations
No you don't have to have a lot of money
You don't have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it's as big as a crew, some say it's as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it's as big as a religion</pre>

"My nigga, what it look like?"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas hating, bitches hating, babies dying
Bullets flying, helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genosism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killing, no cure
Oil spilling, turmoil, poverty-stricken
Police brutality kicking ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines, botox injection, earthquakes that's government testing
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
that turn to crack, then invest it amongst us blacks, just a method
to hold us back, great depression, amongst Iraq no direction
No google map, just a TEC for the soowoo
Swerving Isuzu, then blah-blah-blah, adolescents go cuckoo
Mothers are boo-boo crying, the governor keep us starving
These commercials keep us buying these cigarettes
Supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph, distinctive living with science
No place to live in, no Zion, see that's forbidden, we frying

"My nigga, what it look like?"
That's exactly what Hell look like, uh

[Chorus 2X: Alori Joh]
Tell it like it is, nigga
Tell it like it is, homeboy
Tell it like it is, nigga
Tell it like it is, tell 'em what's up

"My nigga, what it look like?"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spitting
'Pac is rapping, Gregory capping, people singing, bells is ringing
Children playing, angels praying, fourteen carat golden streets
Cali greens, red wine, potato yams, turkey legs
Calling every human being... {*fades out*}</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Dom Kennedy, Javonte, MURS
Album:  Overly Dedicated
Song:   She Needs Me (Remix)
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Intro]
I miss you, where you been?
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, I need you
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, come back to me
Come back, I need you in my life
I miss you, I miss you, come back to me, I miss you

[Dom Kennedy]
What's up baby? It's been a while
You been good? I've been around
different girls, different towns
To keep it real, you missing out
I'll all bored, next city
Random cars, TEC's with me
Like I miss you so much, have sex with me
Not right now, look you know I got the ex with me
She like fuck that, I don't care Dom
So selfish and that really isn't fair Dom
Meet me here, where Dom?
Get undressed, yeah Dom
Yeah Dom, what you need?
Some bomb head? A bag of weed?
Good food? Japanese?
That's me on page forty in that magazine
"Dom Kennedy" you need that
She said nobody come close, I agreed back
I'm the nigga who used to help her pull that weed back
and she need me, believe that

[Chorus: Javonte]
That girl is smoking
and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
and together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on

[Kendrick Lamar]
What's up love? It's been a while
You been good? I've been around
Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chiles
Truant like a student, you the principal
Schooled me on timing, we was both shining
like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond
I was Your Highness, you was my queen
You got over him when I got in between
Watching Martin on TV as it was T-D-S
for us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
Every time I put the head in you would panic
and come right down like an avalanche
Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants
Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir
Wake it back up, Folgers posters
By my waistline, shot for your heart and
You called it a hate crime, say you want me back
and your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit
4-0-1 K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?

[Chorus]

[MURS]
I upped and walked out, now she crying cuz
She need me, I got that John Bryan love
Had to find love, we called it punch-drunk
We was a two-piece, she was a one-punch
You know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out
my heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out
There we go again, what the fuck you talking bout?
We used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house
Smoking beedies, laying on the futon
Memories I got saved up like a coupon
And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
I was broke then, couldn't count the best weed
Then she would just leave in a black hatchback
Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that
I would say yep, smiling so freely
That was back then, but I bet she still need me
She need me, she need me
She need me, she need me
I would say yes, smiling so freely
That was back then, I bet she still need me

[Chorus]</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Brown (Sore Losers), Skeme, U-N-I
Album:  Overly Dedicated
Song:   I Do This (Remix)
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Y-O]
Now I prefer women with some sexy toes
with no corns but enjoys eating vegetables
Seem like everybody love the role of assholes
But I'm feeling better being crowned with some bad hoes
Mr. Michael of Amish yo speaking
Fedora on the top, the black Abraham Lincoln
I hear they fell in love with my penis
Only concerned with my balls like Venus

[Thurz]
Huh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot
Kama Sutra missionary, fuck shit up on top
Say, I'm big time, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch
And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock
Co-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot
U-N-I, T.D.E. be doing it so go head and hop
on that bandwagon of my genitals, not new to me
I'm still serving broads on my chest for gratuity

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Skeme]
Oh Lord, here he come, there they go again
Kendrick got my cover fire, bitch I'm going in
Burn a swisher up, then I roll again
Ee-Jay and Weezy, just make sure that dough keep rolling in, hah!
Got the 'Wood going crazy
Big chrome .380 if a nigga try and play me
Nigga's swag wavy, chauffeur got me car-pooling
So when it come to stunting, bitch I do it

[Brown]
Never been like you or wanted to be, I do me
She found out that I'm in a group, now she's a groupie
Don't need a watch that's full of diamonds to know that it's perfect timing
We be shining blue and brown and got that golden Gucci
Yeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me
T.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County
Country accent, city fashion, lights are flashing on the cameras
Hoes are choosing me cause hating we ain't, pimping, keep our balance

[Chorus 2]

[Kendrick Lamar]
These hoes want to love me mayne
So I'm like, what up? Uh what up?
Uh, bitch I do this remix stupid, fire burning, people looting
That's the chaos, comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses
Chunking deuces, then drop one, dropping music and I won
Call me hot or call me Pac, every eye on me and it's obviously
I'm close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude
You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you
Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC
I'm bout to make that halo burn, goddamn that's some irony
I am the messiah of society
Beside of Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui
I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief
Like beliefs of Mason Betha, reporting from C-P-T motherfucker

Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this</pre>

Song:   Fuck Your Ethnicity
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Intro]
Gather round, I'm glad everybody came out tonight
As we stand on our neighborhood corner
know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have
Listen, Keisha, Tammy, come up front
I recognize all of you, every creed and color
With that being said, fuck your ethnicity, you understand that?
We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you, all of you

Now everybody throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck throw your hands up high
Throw your hands up high

[Chorus]
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddamn it
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity nigga

[Kendrick Lamar]
Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it Hip Hop, I be calling it Hypnotize
Yeah, Hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man I got so much in +store+
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse
They getting off work and that wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benzs, and I been there, so I make it my business
to give 'em my full attention, ten-hut, man I gotta get my wind up
Man I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up, oooh
Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone, I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind
So don't you mind how much the cost it, penny for my thoughts
Everybody please hold up your wallets
Yeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell man?
Going postal, never freeze up when I approach you
That's star-struck, and roast you, oh my, HiiiPoWeR

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all
Do you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock of the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein, before calculus I was kicking in math
Dropping that science like an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass
Lyrically I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me I'ma come back with the head of alien
Don't alienate my dreams, get it right, get a life
I got two, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly
Put wings on my back, that a plane or angel? Both
Like a pilot with a halo, whoa, gross

*sung*
I don't mean nothing, so many things come through
them, him, her, you, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'm just a messenger
Yeah I know life's a bitch, get the best of her

Put them threes up, they notice that we up
HiiiPoWeR, and the power, and the people, and if they don't believe us
they'll die
Wizard

[Chorus]</pre>

Album:  #Section80
Song:   Hol' Up
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all these passengers
they'll probably think I'm a terrorist
Eat my asparagus, then I'm asking her
Thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for diamonds, I know you dying to meet 'em
I'll probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million and a Comp-town fitted

[Chorus]
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit popping, Section 80

[Kendrick Lamar]
Back in this bitch in the back of that bitch
with my back against the wall, and your bitch on the edge of my dick
Jump off, I call a bitch a bitch
A hoe a hoe, a woman a woman, I never did nothing
but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddling
with the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told I'm like '87
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From a distance, don't know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? There's no one, not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody

[Chorus]
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit popping, everybody watching
When you do it like this nigga, losing ain't an option
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit popping
Ay, ay, kick her out the studio Ali

[Kendrick Lamar]
Twenty-four seven nigga, working his ass for it, she popping that ass for it
The King of Diamonds with diamonds I never do ask for
They checking my passport, I'm too accustomed with customs
She call in the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff him
They want me fast-forward the game, and why you complain
when you niggas is past poor? You'll never hop in my lane
When you pushing a RAV4, you wrecking my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard

[Chorus]
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit popping, everybody watching
When you do it like this nigga, losing ain't an option
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit popping, everybody watching
When you do it like this nigga

[Kendrick Lamar]
I wrote this record while thirty-thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all these passengers
they'll probably think I'm Osama
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor, hol' up!</pre>

Song:   A.D.H.D
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh-uh, fuck that

[Chorus]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half, wait nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Kendrick Lamar]
Man I swear, my nigga tripping off that shit again, pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope to take the pain away from the feeling that he feel today
You know when you're part of Section 8, and you feel like no one can relate
cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party tripping off, my generation sipping cough
syrup like it's water, never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up in the daily superstition
that the world is bout to end, who gives a fuck? We never do listen
unless it comes with an 808, a melody and some hoes
PlayStation and some drank, technology bumping 'Soul
Looking around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
and they probably relatives, relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Purple label on her back, but that dap
is like when she take it straight to the head, then she look at me
She got A.D.H.D

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Like whoa-oh, whoa
Whoa-oh, whoa (I don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa-oh, whoa (I don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa-oh, whoa (They always told me A.D.H.D did it)
Whoa-oh

And then she started...
And then she started feeling herself like no one else in this apartment
Beg your pardon how I rap baby, how old are you?
She say twenty-two, I say twenty-three, ok then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that? She said where my drink at?
I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors, have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds, closed the screen, JumboTron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
and the fact that she might just open up when the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound
of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me, then looked
at it, then she grabbed it, then she said get it, understood?
You know why we crack babies, because we born in the eighties
That A.D.H.D crazy

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Like whoa-oh, whoa
Whoa-oh, whoa (I don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa-oh, whoa (I don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa-oh, whoa (They always told me A.D.H.D did it)
Whoa-oh

*sung*
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I love the way you, put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful, all of the time, time, time
And girl that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind?
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day (today)
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day
No makeup today
And girl that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind-mind-mind-mind?

[Kendrick Lamar]
I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
for you to put it on? It was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
From Heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips, all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar] + (female)
I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
for you to put it on? It was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
(Concentrating on the way my) eyeliner thickens
(He stand behind me and try to) figure her vision
(of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
 My complexion in a direction) I've outgrown
(I feel like it's not enough
 I can never put on too much makeup
 Yeah I know) your imperfections (I be constantly stressing
 From him is where I get it from)
 They tell me I need to) smile (at least once in a while
 I hate my lips, my nose, my) eyebrows
(It's the beauty in me, but what he don't see
 is that I had a black eye) *beep*
To be continued, eleven

"Ladies and gentlemen"
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun

"Don't judge me"

[Kendrick Lamar]
I know this girl, she a real good girl, and she be low-key
Looking like a star with a real nice car, a Mercedes key
And she got a nigga, and she love this nigga, well at least I think
Every time we bark she pay us no mind, in the middle of the street
She be like

[Chorus 1] * {Each chorus is an interpretation of the chorus from "Down 4 My Niggas" by Snoop Dogg}
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other...

[Kendrick Lamar]
Until one day he wasn't acting right, in the middle of the night
she checked his phone, Erica, right? When he plead the fifth
Man, it was on, matter of fact she gone, matter of fact Tyrone
was on speed dial, so when she got home, it was going down
She go

[Chorus 2]
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other...

[Kendrick Lamar]
I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit
Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks
with that big butt, but when I try holla, she gon' resist
In her man she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this
She be like

[Chorus 1]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Until one day he wasn't acting right, in the middle of the night
she checked his pockets, found condoms by Magnum, and the moment
they was acknowledged, she popped his eye, then ran outside
Then started driving on the passenger side, homeboy was smiling
She go

[Chorus 2]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And so these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up
Put 'em in they world, they vulnerable world, and just like that it was
only getting-got they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound?
They got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now
Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
to lend each other, uncover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over, it will be alright
The minute she hit the block and turn left, she be turning dyke
They go

[Chorus 3]
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas {*laughter*}
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches on the side cause these niggas
...

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar] - {repeat 2X}
Riding with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one, one, one, one
Whoa-ohhh, whoa-ohhh
We make it to twenty-one, one, one, one
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Interlude]
I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils
There's an even more important topic I'd like to discuss
The dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan era
Young men that learned to do everything spiteful
This is your generation, live fast and die young
Who's willing to explain this story?

[Refrain] - {repeat 1.5X}</pre>

Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Ashtro Bot]
We're far from good, not good from far
Ninety miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
with the top down screaming we don't give a fuck
Drink my forty ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
cause the kids just ain't alright

[Interlude]
Oh shit nigga, something bout to happen
Nigga, this shit, nigga, this sound like thirty ki's under the Compton court building
Hope the dogs don't smell it

[Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to vigilante, eighties so don't you ask me
I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fucking pantry
Peeling off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you getting fucked, uh
You ain't heard nothing harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a traveling freight train
Are you trained, to go against Dracula?
Dragging the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips and gold chains
You walk around with a P-90 like it's the 90s
Bullet to your temple, you're homicidal, remind me, that

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (RZA)
Compton Crip niggas ain't nothing to fuck with
Bompton Pirus ain't nothing to fuck with
Compton eses ain't nothing to fuck with
But they fuck with me, and bitch I love it
Woop-de-woop, woop-de-woop-woop, woop-de-woop
Woop-de-woop, woop-de-woop-woop (California dungeons)
Woop-de-woop, woop-de-woop-woop, woop-de-woop
Woop-de-woop, woop-de-woop-woop (California dungeons)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Let's hit the county building, gotta cash my check
Spend it all on a forty-ounce to the neck
And in retrospect I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars, neighborhood wars and stolen Mazdas
I tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down, get a six-four, better know how to drive it
I'm driving on E with no license or registration
Heart racing, racing past Johnny because he's racist
1987, the children on Ronald Reagan
raked the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch
(I'm really out here nigga) You blowing on stress hoping to ease the stress
(Like, really out here) He copping some blow, hoping that he can stretch
Newborn massacre, hopping out the passenger
with calendars, cause your day coming
Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hoping that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothing, because

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Can't detour when you at war with your city, why run for it?
Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store right there
When you fight don't fight fair, cause you'll never win
(Right, I had the chopper and I tore they ass up)
Can't detour when you at war with your city, why run for it?
Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store right there
When you fight don't fight fair, cause you'll never win, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

[Outro]
We really out here my nigga, you niggas don't understand my nigga
I'm off of pill and Remy Red my nigga, tripping my nigga</pre>

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke good, eat good, live good *4X*

[Kendrick Lamar]
I used to want to see the penitentiary, way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalised
my intuition has said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressing, my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
every minute, hour and second, ministers tried
to save me, how I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
I deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun
and you'll be looking in my eyes homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, twenty-three hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
that you hear the music I wrote, hope it get you off death row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A MetroPC' phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
I'ma get it right just so you

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke good, eat good, live good *5X*

[GLC]
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to ya, holler if you hear me

[Kendrick Lamar]
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
I'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
I'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful, the city got my back
Before that, I give them my torso
You think about it, and don't call me lyrical
cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worry some individuals that live life critical
So won't you bare witness while I bare feet
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On "Wanna Be Heard" probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me, getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio, he ain't know
I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it, he'll probably be
out of work, laid back, while he

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke good, eat good, live good *5X*

[GLC]
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to ya, holler if you hear me

[Outro: GLC]
Church is definitely on the move, and now that we took it up to the cathedral
cause the ism is enormous, you know what I'm talking bout?
We out here rotating under the five Ps
Proper preparation prevents poor performance, you know what I'm talking bout?
Doing my thing, cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping
from the Windy City streets all the way out here to the streets of Compton
Know what I'm talking bout? Church is definitely on the move
and we gon' continue to hustle and grow and develop by far
As I rotate with my true player partner by the name of Kendrick Lamar
You know what I'm talking bout?
This is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking bout?
You gotta get up off your ass and get it man
That's the only way your pockets gonna expand
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking bout?
Apply yourself to supply your wealth
Only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yourself
Church is definitely on the move, you know what I'm talking bout?
Exercise your ism and don't depend on no one else
Cathedral, chuuch! Ism</pre>

Song:   The Spiteful Chant
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number I don't ever pick up
I don't owe you shit bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
and some of you niggas acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
to politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
and most of you niggas acting like hoes

[Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I do is turelem now
I'ma take my time, I'ma master it
You should be mindful of a mastermind
Put a land mine right where your momma live
Now blow up, blow up
Hold up, I've seen your kind before
You see me as a dollar sign
till I resign on your report
that I done you wrong
And I'm in the know, my homie never
Nigga right now, it's now or never
Nigga right now I'm high as ever, but however

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody heard that I fuck with Dre
and they wanna tell me I made it
Nigga, I ain't made shit
If he gave me a handout I'ma take his wrist and break it
Nigga, I'm faded off of that Nuvo
Chilling with two hoes in here
and they tie my laces
Living the Matrix as them pills disappear
Me and my niggas just acting bad
HiiiPoWeR conglomerate
Living that life and counting this cash
Old friends I no longer have

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number I don't ever pick up
I don't owe you shit bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
and some of you niggas acting like hoes

[Schoolboy Q] + (Kendrick Lamar)
Yeah, I remember when I came out and shit
Man it's been so long since they seen my dick
Probably been five months since I've seen my seed
Goddamn it K. Dot, when it come to this?
When I was sleeping on couches
Nigga couldn't get a call, just a Glock for my belt yeah
Nigga I was motherfucking out yeah
with the flashing lights, had me stuck like Reindeer
When I should've been bank yeah
I was somewhere stuck with a flame yeah
Motherfucker, see how far that I came here
Went broke and I came up in the same year
Can I get a hell yeah?
Uh, drop my chair, hold my joy, show my pride
(Music saved my fucking life
 I'm doing right and you left behind
 Feel my pain, now I'm styling
 Hear this shit, I spent a thousand
 Different homes, different islands)
Dropped my mixtape and it sold like an album
Reason why I'm

[Chorus 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I be going big, bitch suck my dick
Yeah I'm going big, bitch suck my dick
Tell 'em I'm going big, bitch suck my dick
Yeah I'm going big, bitch suck my dick
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
and some of you niggas acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
to politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
and most of you niggas acting like hoes

[uncredited female]

In time, you'll learn this is about you
In time, you'll learn this is about you
In time, you'll learn this is about you

[Kendrick Lamar]
Babies from eighties don't know no' better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance
But the belligerent kids that we living with
Some of them masculine, some of them feminine
'Member the universe used to innocent?
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Every day that I wake up, I'ma sin again
I'm not a citizen, I'm just a nigga from Section 80

[Interlude]
Show of hands, how many been taking notes?
Good, leave everything on the table now
On the real, this is your generation
Show, show your pain</pre>

Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus: Ashtro Bot]
Fancy girls, on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She takes the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
The seven cars start honking, she start running
like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give all to her daddy, but she don't know her father, that's ironic
See a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
and it's quite simple, her castle is bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers and dummies that look like decoys
Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure
of the black man, white man, needing satisfaction
At first it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing
through that block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left her dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song

Mm, my little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
the day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play

[Chorus: 2X]</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
Alright here we go, third take
{*clears throat*} Real quick Ali, mm

[Chorus 1]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yessir
(Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him
(Amen) Bitch

[Kendrick Lamar]
And this is riga-mortis
and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus
The Matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit
You an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme
If you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin
and then I end on cloud nine
And that's important when you morph
into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures
My listeners reply
and tell me that you biting style
You got a hell of an appetite
And I'ma be here for a while
Just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up if you could fight
We always making them duck or die
A suit and a tie is suitable
and usual, it's suicide
CSI just might investigate
this fucking parasite

(He dead)
(Amen)

That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity
This is studio felony
Feragami so many
and cool enough for the seventies
Nigga, payback's a bitch
and bitch you been living in debt with me
That I'm more than especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail
to say he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant
Rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody
Couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q
It's just me, Jay Rock, 'Soul and Q
So the system ain't why we cute
Nothing else you can do

[Chorus 2]
(He dead) Yep, yep
(Amen) I killed him
(He dead) {*laughs*}
(Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yep, yep
(Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure
(Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

[Kendrick Lamar]
I rapped him and made him Casper
I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya
I'll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners
Won't you send us to bible study faster?
Your hypocrite is reaction of blasphemy
I assassin my casualty
and it's casually done
And tell 'em my salary come
in lumps of a hundreds
Don't talk to me bout no money
The sun is under my feet
and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you'd rather leap
My statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest street
and I get busy on many emcees
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody done see
some persistence, recognize I be
really too vicious, the permanent beast
and the demolition breaking up the streets
Better partition, better dot you T
and I gon' mention, how the fog you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
and I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
is star-struck, and the audacity
of y'all fucks, never could hassle me
and y'all luck, just ran out, you'll see

[Chorus 3]
(He dead) Yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure
(Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yep, yep
(Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure
(Amen) Amen</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
Check, check, check, check...
It go

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Ride to it, ride to it, cause you never know
when a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things, don't do it like
he did, cause he ain't what you is, but we can win
Wait, let's get straight to the point

[Kendrick Lamar]
To the meaning of life, what's my purpose?
Maybe this earth is, ain't a good place to be
How far is Heaven? Let's see
Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I die will he give me receipts?
I wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me?
Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner
I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer
What I'm doing, I'm saying that I'm human, now people just

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
It go one, two, three
Two in the front, one in the back seat, seat
Seat, seat, looking for a victim of an AK-47
Hundred round each, each, each
But why must we retaliate? Is it human nature?
I don't know, I look for the answers later
Make a right, there they go, sometimes gotta

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the Heavens
A condom, a rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I'm right on the edge on Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking lie
When I lie on back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face, then tell me don't worry bout it
I give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wildin', a youngun with lack of guidance
There's hundreds of us with problems, more money, more drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist that's dealing with life the hardest
That's on my life, but regardless I'ma

[Chorus]

[BJ the Chicago Kid]
Yeah, life can please ya, but death can tease ya
On the day Niko had that seizure, I lost one of my biggest believers, ohh
Close deaths make you think about your life
like if I had the same chance twice, what would I do different?
I'd tell her I loved her more, do more
but tease her bout crying on that picture
Now when I'm done recording, swear I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in Heaven saying they at it again
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Don't take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Now my love life murking it, family having surgeries
Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
Lord, what kind of life is this?
Mama, I just wanna sing
Mama said, according to get everything
you gotta risk everything
So I'm smoking my kush reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush reading Corinthians

*BJ the Chicago Kid croons to end*</pre>

Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus: screwed Pimp C sample from Jay-Z's "Big Pimpin'"] + (Kendrick Lamar)
"Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
 All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
 Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
 If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all"
(Pussy ass hoe niggas) "I can't fuck with y'all"
(Bitches all up in my business) "I can't fuck with y'all"
(Industry of counterfeits) "I can't fuck with y'all"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Taking off when you landing
Bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums
And I'm dancing on them stars
The galaxy ain't got room for y'all
Ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all
while I'm here, and every day I hear
your bullshit, self-pity
Reason why you never dealt with me
Reason why your girl dealt with me
Hands up in the building, we get busy, and say
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep
That's exactly what this sound like
A to the A to the L-I-Y
A-H, give it up two times
Then give it right back, don't blow my high

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look at my life, then look at yours
Get some ambition, why you bored?
Time will never wait on no man
Society will never hold your hand
Niggas like to gossip like bitches
Got me thinking you don't like bitches
Wonder what's behind them Ray Bans
Eyes of a coward, I understand
Niggas like to gossip like bitches
Sip Don Perignon, when we finish, we say
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep
That's exactly what this sound like
But never will I ever forget Left Eye
Roll up, put a ribbon in the sky
and a button on your lips, don't blow my high

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody sing this shit

*sung by female*
I'm sending him a four-page letter
and I enclose it with a kiss
And when I write, he'll be better
Get it on time

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look at my life and look at yours
Get some ambition, why you bored?
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P</pre>

Album:  #Section80
Song:   Ab-Soul's Outro
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Ab-Soul]
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
There's fire in the street, fire in my swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
before they crop us out the picture
I've never seen a crop circle
but I've cops circle the block, I puff squares
But I swear one day I'ma stop, my nerves itch
On the brink of my career while my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams? (Uncle Sam ain't no killing me)
One, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary

*sung by female*
Section 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan
We raising hell

[Ab-Soul]
Lord forbid
The homie got wet, so we tryna soak it in
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you can see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world, but we gon' manipulate it
I hope you participating
Aiyyo Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here like back in '04
Started HiiiPoWeR because our generation needed a generator
and the system made to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist 'em
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like, what if kids were celibate?
Or what is Tammy came across a real man
who didn't play games like chil-dren?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
with his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off twenty-twelve
and the extraterrestrial presence as well
(Odd Future's aight) but our future's not
That martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast-food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine-to-five
Don't forget to pay your tithes, and thank God you alive (HiiiPoWeR)
And on another note
we focussed like the Hubble Telescope, 'Soul

[Kendrick Lamar] + (female)
Life is a traffic jam (life is a traffic jam)
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam (ready to go)
Life is a traffic jam (ready to go)
Life is a traffic jam (ready to go)
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam

[Kendrick Lamar]
I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie? I do
Section 80, your son will play me if radio won't
Daughters that just turned one to twenty-one listen to Kendrick
For instance

[Ab-Soul]
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan and pay off your college degree
and do exactly what you see on TV

[Kendrick Lamar]
True story
Hmm, can you repeat that for me 'Soul?

[Ab-Soul]
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now my child, come on

[Kendrick Lamar]
See a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God and history
all in the same sentence
You know what all them things have in common?
Only half of the truth if you tell it
See I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
till one day I realised I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in, I'm not on inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking centre looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God and history
all in the same sentence
just know I meant it, and you felt it
cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially aware rapper
I am a human motherfucking being over dope ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar
Now fuck 'em up Terrace
('Soul!)

[Outro]
I watch this fire that we're gathered around
and see that it burns similar to the fire that's inside you
Section 80, Section 80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
No they can't control us, no they can't control you
No they can't control us, but we control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight, you will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something that's bigger than all of us
or our family
Heart, honor and represent
This is you, this is me, and we are HiiiPoWeR

Song:   HiiiPoWeR
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section 80, HiiiPoWeR

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
how to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar-coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want no plastic nation, +dread+ that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

[Chorus]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his, HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Kendrick Lamar]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uhh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh
Dear Lord come save me, the Devil's working hard
He probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license
to kill, I'm standing on a field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Trying to be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

[Chorus]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his, HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Alori Joh] + (Kendrick Lamar)
Every day we fight the system
just to make our way, we been down for too long
But that's alright, we was built to be strong
cause it's our life, na-na-nah
Every day we fight the system
We fight the system
We fight the system
(Never liked the system)
We been down for too long
But that's alright, na-na-nah

[Kendrick Lamar]
Who said a black man in Illuminati?
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
on the freeway to Africa till I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
loaded that clip and then said "Bang!", the drama it bring
is crazy, product of the late 80s
Trying to stay above water, that's why we shun the Navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs

[Chorus]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his, HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Kendrick Lamar]

Song:   Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter's Daughter
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro]
"Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins; I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life and be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus name, Amen"

[Kendrick Lamar]
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump, she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello my name is Kendrick" she said "No, you're handsome"
Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now (cool)
"Where you stay?" She said "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount; "Well is it Compton?"
"No" she replied and quickly start battin' her eyes and
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, "What you tryna get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well
The summer had passed and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we having probably enticin' her
Who could imagine? Maybe my actions would end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck cause the trife in us
It's deep rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
It's never muted, in fact it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
"I wanna come over, what's up?" That's what I told her 
soon as this episode of "Martin" go off, I'm tryin' to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of bein' thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
I'm thinkin' bout that sex - thinkin' bout her thighs 
or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what positions next
Sent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Chorus]
I am a sinner.. who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me.. Lord forgive me - things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone....
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music, I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my VIBE, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous; I can say that I like a challenge 
and you to me is painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this, tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Interlude]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people around me 
just want to be famous; you can see that my city found me 
then put me on stages, to me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check with all disrespect let me say this

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you; we live in a world, we live in a world 
on two different axles; you live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to; this shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name; I'll let the people know 
this is something you can blame on yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
I'mma break out and then hide every lock, I'mma break out and then hide every lock

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Outro]
Bitch don't kill my vibe; you ain't heard a chorus 
like this in a long time - don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air I can see you are, in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Skit]
"Ay K-Dot, get in the car, nigga
Come on, we finna roll out
Got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo freestyles ready."</pre>

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh, Martin had a DREAM!
Martin had a DREAM~! Kendrick have a DREAM~!!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Kendrick Lamar]
Goddamn I feel amazin', damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is livin' on Cloud 9 and this nine is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and VROOM-VROOM I'm racin'
Poppin pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screamin'

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Goddamn I got bitches (okay) damn I got bitches (okay)
Damn I got bitches (yeah) wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower

[Kendrick Lamar]
I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yessir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin', I'm holdin', my scrotum, and posin'
This voice here is golden so fuck y'all, I goes in and

[Chorus]

[Interlude] - minus last 4 words

[Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga, it's GO TIME~!
I roll in dough with a good grind and I run at hoe with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet, they say "K, you gon' marry mines"
BEYOTCH~! No way; BEYOTCH~! No way
BEYOTCH~! No way; BEYOTCH~! Okay
I'm never livin' life confined, it's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who, what, when, where, how to sell your game right on time
BEYOTCH~! Go play; BEYOTCH~! Go play
BEYOTCH~! Go play; BEYOTCH~! I look like OJ
Killin' everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city mobbin' in the street, yellin'

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
(Let it run, Ali) Martin had a DREAM!
Martin had a DREAM~! Kendrick have a DREAM~!!</pre>

Album:  The Art of Peer Pressure (S)
Song:   The Art of Peer Pressure
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the Federales will roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches in trouble
I hope the universe love you today
cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
a flock of positive activists and fill their body with hate, if it's necessary
Bumping Jeezy' first album, looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hot-boxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
and asked them what they working with, look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth, usually I'm drug-free
But shit, I'm with the homies

(Yeah nigga, we off of pill and Remy Red
 Come through and bust ya head nigga)
Me and the homies
(Sag all the way to the liquor store
 where my niggas pour up fo' and get twisted some more)
Me and the homies
(I ride for my motherfucking niggas
 Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)
Me and the homies
(Matter of fact, I hope out that motherfucker
 and be like, do-do-do-do~! Do-do-do-do-do~!)

It's 2:30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke, and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy, and if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 4-0-5, passing Westchester
You know the light-skinned girls in all their little dresses, good Lord
They knew we weren't from round there
cause every time we down there, we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked the conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like, then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger
I mean I never was stranger to the folk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick, and then we laugh about it
That's ironic cause I've never been violent
until I'm with the homies

(Just riding, just riding)
Me and the homies
(Bullshitting, acting a fool)
Me and the homies
(Tripping, really tripping)
Me and the homies
(Just riding, just riding, just riding)

Bragging bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, beefing if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still, nigga what is you saying?
Pull in front of the house that we've been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called, kicking it
I should have told her I'm probably bout to catch my first offense
with the homies

{*police sirens ring*}

But they made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies

(And this is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure)
Me and the homies
(This is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure)
Me and the homies
(And this is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure)
Me and the homies
(This is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure)</pre>

Song:   Money Trees
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, me and my niggas tryin' to get it, ya bish (ya bish)
Hit the house lick, tell me is you with it, ya bish? (ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (was persuasive)
From nine-to-five I know it's vacant, ya bish (ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane then went to tell my bros (tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on (burn came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (ya bish)
Park the car then we start rhymin', ya bish (ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (see dollar signs)
You lookin' like an easy come up, ya bish (ya bish)
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish (ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (we never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue

[Chorus One: Kendrick Lamar + Anna Wise]
It go Halle Berry, or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun lives forever)
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel

[Chorus Two: Kendrick Lamar + Anna Wise]
Nah, nah; a dollar might just fuck your main bitch, that's just how I feel
Nah; a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with, that's just how I feel
Nah, nah; a dollar might, just make that lane switch, that's just how I feel
Nah; a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how I feel

[Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 after school (after school)
You know "Big Ballin' with my Homies" (my homies)
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (thinkin' rational)
Back to reality we poor, ya bish (ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (Uncle Tony head)
He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish (ya bish)
That Louis Burger'll never be the same (be the same)
A Louis belt will never ease that pain (ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin' (Pirelli's skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish)
Hopin' all of em offend you, ya bish (ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (a pot of gold)
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Interlude 2X: Anna Wise]
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way
Hit the streets then we break the code? No way
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way

[Jay Rock]
Imagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda, yola whippin', ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, everyday I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em, get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurkin' blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

[Chorus One]</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Drake
Album:  Good Kid: M.A.A.D City
Song:   Poetic Justice
Typed by: OHHLA

Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!

[Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty range I heard that
She wanna go and party, She wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
'less I write it down for real, P.S

[Chorus 2X: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song

[Drake]
I really hope you play this
Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice, Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.S...

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve
Every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking poor maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P.S.....

[Chorus]</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Pharrell 
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   good kid
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside these walls and you see them havin' withdrawals
of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir what do you require to sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey, I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building, it's probably big as a building
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I supposed to do when the topic is red or blue
and you understand that I ain't but know I'm accustomed to?
Just a couple that look for trouble and live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind because one day you'll respect, the +good kid, m.A.A.d. city+

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
All I see is strobe lights, blinding me in my hindsight
Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help 
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standin' still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof?
And you ask "Lift up your shirt" cause you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter "He's probably young but I know that he's down"
Step on his neck as hard as your bulletproof vest
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect, the +good kid, m.A.A.d. city+

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
All I see in this room, 20 Xanies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane society?
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20 Xanies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it, I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind cause now you ever in debt, to +good kid, m.A.A.d. city+

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ MC Eiht, Schoolboy Q
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   m.A.A.d city
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] + (Schoolboy Q)
If Pirus and Crips all got along 
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear (YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!)

[Chorus]
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was Me, L-Boogs and Yan-Yan, YG, Lucky ridin' down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' your hand out the window, check yo self
Uh, warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance 
with society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where {*censored*} hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time with the slidin' door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets comin from
AK's, AR's, "Aye y'all, duck"
That's what momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all Hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces, BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
m.A.A.d city

[Chorus] 

[Intro] - last "YAWK!" replaced with {*static*}

{*beat changes*}

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
Wake yo punk ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
Gyeah! Real simple and plain
I'ma teach you some lessons about the street
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
Chyea, how we do

[Kendrick Lamar]
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin' in the livin' room in my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick a.k.a Compton's human sacrifice

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
Gyeah! Cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the 80's loc
Sherm sticks, butt nakeds
Dip make a nigga flip
Cluckheads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit, block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

[MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc yeah that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grand's where a motherfucker stand

[Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me
Or see me to be, innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
with a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn, they vandalizin'
The option of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive, hit the powder 
Then watch this flame that arrive in his eye, this a coward
The concept is aim and they bang it and slide, out that bitch with deposits
And the price on his head, the tithes, probably go to the projects
I, live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A., made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what

[Intro]
Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now I done grew up round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
that I'ma get fucked up, filling up my cup, I see the crowd move
Changing by the minute, and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)

[Kendrick Lamar]
"OK, now open your mind up and listen me Kendrick
 I am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history Kendrick
 I know that you're nauseous right now, and I'm hoping to lead you to victory Kendrick"
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison abusing my limit
I think that I'm feeling the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feeling, the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice, then apparently
I'm over-influenced by what you are doing, I thought I was doing the most, then someone said to me

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar] - {repeat 2X}
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one-hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you, bang?
Two chopper, two-hundred shots, bang

Song:   Sing About Me
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
When the lights shut off, and it's my turn
to settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off, and it's my turn
to settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow, I'm hopin' that I can borrow
a peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted, I find nothin' but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction or a reaction
of what we consider madness, I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering "Get 'em!"
I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n in pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes, it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope {*three gunshots*}

[Chorus] - minus first two lines

[Kendrick Lamar]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it "Section.80," the message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"
What's crazy was I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well it's completely my future, her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that 40 dollars
Even if I gotta fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinglin' keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em back
to where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet a leader, you need her to learn something
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted but fuck that "sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryin' to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait
.. Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
{*fading*} You lyin' to these motherfuckers, talkin' about you can help 'em
With my story, you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away? It it's today I hope I hear a
cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
rake in the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon and if I'm doomed
May the wound help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror
Get tougher to watch, I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told"
Cursin' the life of 20 generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin'
Or steady being distracted by money, drugs, and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it? ..
Did I put enough work in? ..

[Chorus] - minus first two lines

[female singer - repeat 4X]
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for, ooohhh...</pre>

Song:   I'm Dying of Thirst *
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

* song starts after "Sing About Me" at the 7:29 mark

[Kendrick Lamar]
Tired of runnin', uh, tired of huntin'
Uh, my own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Uh, tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Uh, hands on the wheel, uh, who said we wasn't
Uh, dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst?

Uh, dope on the corner, uh, look at the coroner
Uh, daughter is dead, uh, mother is mournin' her
Uh, strayed bullets, uh, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently but they couldn't
Uh, bring her back, uh, who got the footage?
Uh, Channel 9, uh, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Uh, banana clip, split his banana puddin'
Uh, I'm like Tre, uh, that's Cuba Gooding
Uh, I know I'm good at, uh, dyin' of thirst
Uh, dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst

Uh, how many sins? Uh, I'm runnin' out
Uh, how many sins? Uh, I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding but only shotty bounce
Uh, the reaper callin', uh, I'm cottonmouth
Uh, money is power (money is power) yours is ours (yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, uh, die with a coward
Uh, hope we get rich, uh, hope we can tower
Uh, over the city with vanity with the music louder
Uh, the same song, uh, a black flower
Uh, I'll show you how to, uh, dye your thirst
Uh, dye your thirst, uh, dye your thirst

Uh, what are we doin'? (what are we doin'?) Uh, who are we foolin'? (Who are we foolin'?)
Uh, Hell is hot (Hell is hot) uh, fire is proven (fire is proven)
Uh, to burn for eternity, return of the student
that never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Uh, tired of runnin', uh, choirs is hummin'
Uh, tell us to visit, uh, we lyin' 'bout comin'
Uh, now back to business, uh, loadin' the guns in
Uh, back of the Buick, your hood is feudin' and the beef is bubblin'
Uh, it's no discussion, uh, hereditary
Uh, all of my cousins, uh, dyin' of thirst
Uh, dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst

Uh, too many sins, uh, I'm runnin' out
Uh, somebody send me, a well for the drought
Uh, see all I know, uh, is takin' notes
Uh, on takin' this life for granted, granted if he provoke
Uh, my best days, uh, I stress days 
(Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know)
My best days, uh, I stress days
Uh, say "Fuck the world", uh, my sex slave
Uh, money, pussy and greed; what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Uh, tired of runnin' (tired of runnin') tired of runnin' (tired of runnin')
Tired of tumblin' (tired of tumblin') tired of runnin' (tired of runnin')
Uh, tired of tumblin'
Back once my momma said "See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Anna Wise
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   Real
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Chorus: Kendrick + Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel
and I.. look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real {*4X*}

[Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold with the sequin
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it, when you don't love yourself?

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word "but", but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause you're the homie that packed
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real

[Kendrick's father]
"Kenny I ain't trippin' off that Dominos anymore, just calling. 
Sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did homie.
Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga.
Real is responsibility, real is taking care of your motherfucking family, real is god, nigga."

[Chorus]

[Kendrick's father]
"Alright that's all I wanted to tell you
Just make sure you call us back when you get this message
Here go your mom."

[Kendrick's mother]
"Boy you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin. 
Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there 
by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you
about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. 
Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. 
I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. 
But look, you take this music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. 
Shit, you know we from Chicago you know that's what we do."

[Interlude: Anna Wise]
Sing my song, it's all for you {*16X*}

[Kendrick's mother]
"If I don't hear from you, by tomorrow, I hope you come back, and learn from your mistakes. 
Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton.
Let 'em know you was just like them,
but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. 
But when you do make it, give back, with your words of encouragement,
and that's the best way to give back. 
To your city... and I love you Kendrick
If I don't hear you knocking on the door, you know where I usually leave the key. 
Alright? Talk to you later, bye."

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Dr. Dre
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   Compton
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar: King Kendrick and I meant it
My point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered bein' the master at dodgin' your honor and the chapter that read at 25 
I would live dormant like five in the mornin'
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performin' and if they take everything, know I got

[Chorus: male singer]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mi-iiine...

[Kendrick] Ay Dre, what's happenin' wit it, my nigga?

[Dr. Dre]
Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughin' at the critics talkin', I can see 'em gaggin'
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
with a batch of them bangin' Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthin' this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way 
from a hundred dollars a month to a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
... So come and visit 
the tire screechin', ambulance, policemen
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans, nigga?
Khaki creasin', crime increasin' on Rosecrans, nigga; Kendrick Conan, nigga
Where you sword at? Hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters, Kama Sutra scream 
"Fuck your position and make you hold that"
I'm tryin' to stay grounded like four flats but I know flats and Piru Crip tats

[male singer]
Will swarm on me like a beehive, hop in the G ride
From the West to the Eastside, know that's just how Compton rooooll...

[Dr. Dre]
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course, that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it

[Kendrick Lamar]
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time, we throw up a record
Dependin' on what you expectin', I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in

[Chorus]

[Dr. Dre]
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'ma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
in my direction, you never questioned when I said I
would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you, we gon' test drive
A Lambo in Heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flyin' back to my city cause I'll forever standby

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, it's controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
to the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play
with them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of RosÃ©
This was brought to you by Dre, now every motherfucker in here say

[Outro: male singer] + (Kendrick Lamar)
Look who's responsible 
for takin' Compton international; I make 'em holla, oooohhh...
(Aiyyo Just Blaze, good lookin' homie)
{"Just Blaze!"} Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton.. ain't no city quite like mine</pre>

Song:   The Recipe
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Dr. Dre] + (Kendrick Lamar)
Every morning when I wake up, uh, money on my mind
Good time to get caked up, uh, sunshine coming through my blinds
I'm living but, really though, it's never enough
10 million, that's a must, living in California, everybody want to visit for
(women, weed and weather), they come for (women, weed and weather)
(For the women, weed and weather), from all around the world for the (women, weed and weather)
These niggas will kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still, everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive down the block and you look outside?
H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
Roll it up baby, come lift that dress, then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Dr. Dre)
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-town, I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather, (they come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather, (from all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather, don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to L.A.

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
three Ws, only for a three-day run
Bitch, take them motherfucking panties off, you ain't no nun
Shit, I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
"Ribbon in the Sky" on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living till I am old
We want to be one to peak on the charts, so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon, cause she on the B.S. before we can start
Uh, fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessey, and for my niggas O.G. Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job, boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost, for this life, controlling my price
No way, hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be one to peak on the charts, so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
that it's eighty-two degrees and my top peeled off

[Chorus]

[Dr. Dre]
Uh, known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double Ds, got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, motherfuck your opinion
Huh, how many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion
Hey, we on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck till the morning
Time, and I got time, and I know that I'm in a position of controlling
anything out by that ocean, I'm a boss, I'll buy that ocean
Ain't nobody fucking with this

[Kendrick Lamar]
They want that shit, they often fiend, I give it to 'em, but in between
my time, I gotta tie shoestrings, life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean toward three Ws in life
You know blow job need an application and eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like 'em brown just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand-me-downs, see if you fuck then it's after me
You know how much I'ma make it work? You know her trust living in her purse
When you discuss your love for lust, just make sure you visit here first, Cali

[Chorus]</pre>

Song:   Black Boy Fly
Typed by: OHHLA

[Intro]
So I'm saying "What up what up? Nigga you made it." {*3X*}
Frustrated and I'm riding down the back streets
Making my conscious ask me
"Would I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
Black boy fly {*2X*}
Black-black boy fly
Black boy fly

[Kendrick Lamar]
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo, he was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym
We was living in sorrow
Total envy of him
He made a dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way out of Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score 30
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
11 graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly

[Chorus]
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy...

[Kendrick Lamar]
I used to jealous of Jayceon
I used to jealous of Jayceon, Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
Its 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game they line in front of the store
Swap meets selling our mixtapes I'm like oh shit, wait
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion I was defending my insecurities
Chillin my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
A Boy touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
Only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy
All these niggaz facetious and they all standing beside me
They all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
When 2 niggaz making it out had never sounded logical
3 niggaz making it out, that's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cuz of the talents they got
I was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly...
Out of Compton

Thank God...
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly </pre>

Album:  Good Kid: M.A.A.D City
Song:   Now or Never
Typed by: OHHLA

We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!

[Kendrick Lamar]
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here

[Mary J. Blige]
Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am

[Chorus]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time, and it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better

[Kendrick Lamar]
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth
Cuz the people that hurt can't understand it
You speakin outlandish, I'm ashamed how to make it all work
Another planet, it's a short term role for me
I rec it's all for me, it's just mo with me
And you're here for you too here can re-persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin off, I ain't takin off these pistons
I'm takin off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much it'd cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a shortterm goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
A word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours

[Mary J. Blige]
I see myself performing at
Soldout shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammys, winning 5 awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling every day
Cause my dream ain't far away

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
You're looking at me and tell me I'm blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I'm at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I'm a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow I'mma take that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I root
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin to you, I was walkin it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello

[Mary J. Blige]
And I'm so happy I cry
Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you play so hard
And you've come so far
And you go, that is the time for you to leave your more
And I'm gonna do it
Watch me

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>

Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   County Building Blues (Bonus Track)
Typed by: Hdub

[Intro]
Greetings boys and girls
(Greetings boys and girls)
My name is Petey P. 
(My name is Petey P.)
Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend (that's right, that's right, that's right)
I am your neighbor (I am your neighbor)
And I'd like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city (good kid, m.A.A.d city)
So grab your cartoons and cereal (and sing)
Your pop guns (and sing) and fireworks and sing along

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Sing along kids, sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah

(Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...)

[Kendrick]
I've been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at 95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
we was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers to move
With nothing else to lose but a burger flippin' job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine this a mansion
Gold ballroom AK-47 dancing
Howling at the moon was a pack of hungry babies
Hope you feed 'em soon bite your back you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table of Sizzlers
But never made that visit, if better days was on its way
Then it made the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
(Oh yeah I remember that, it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?)

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (Am I right?)
Spend it all in front of the county building (oh)
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah

And all the ghetto children in the world say that's my car
All the ghetto boys say that's my car
All the ghetto girls say that's my car
When we grow up, when we grow up
Ghetto children in the world say that's my car
All the ghetto boys say that's my car
All the ghetto girls say that's my car
When we grow up, when we grow up

(Nig-nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?)

[Kendrick]
Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety (uh huh)
Played the passenger I think it's five years after eighty-
seven do the math ' 92 don't you be lazy (I won't)
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
of a block party that stop for a second then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle everybody got dental
Insurance 'cause we 'bout to floss
you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away probably had credentials
of a scholar but shit not today
them Dayton spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi I want them ten woo-woofers
Say that you got me if not I'll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bull's eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
Papa you really telling me we can just get some more of it if we run out?
He said lil nigga today the poor is rich
Don't tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don't forget
Bitches ain't shit, hoes ain't neither
Niggas gon' snitch watch the company you keeping
And one day you'll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots
(That's right the mothafuckin' Rodney King
you just put your daddy on Bullis Rd.)

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (that's crazy)
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Don't forget still sing along kids, still sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (Please sing)
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah

Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   Swimming Pools (Black Hippy Remix) (Bonus Track)
Typed by: Hdub

[Intro]
Playas always tryin to pop bottles
Niggas love to pop bottles
Man get you a table my nigga
Go get you a table my nigga

Pour up (drank) Head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank) stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank) wake up (drank)
Faded (drank) faded (drank)

[Jay Rock]
No syrup in this cup but this the pour up
When you see me pour up
Turn up 'til you throw up
Like a bulimic fiendin for hurl over them toilets
If I run outta liquor in yo' city yo where the store at?
One bottle two bottles I'm a soldier never sober
Cup runneth over don't give a fuck bout Cirrhosis
One life that's all we have ok let's toast to that
Then dive in a pool full of liquor
Swim laps like Michael Phelps

[Chorus]
Nigga why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'm a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I gotta swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm a dive in it
Pour up (drank) Head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank) stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank) wake up (drank)
Faded (drank) faded (drank)

[Ab-Soul]
(Yeah) Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize
Hope this dollar shot of E&J'll take the pain away
Aim and shoot, shots of Ciroc'll make the girls get loose wit it
We all trippin off that Henn like a female chicken (You wit it?)
Yeah spread yo wings you probably won't get far
I honestly wouldn't advise operating a car
Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya
End up giving it up in the restroom like the rest of 'em

[Chorus]

[ScHoolBoy Q]
So it's that groovy little nigga known for poppin them bottles
Under my pants be a golden dead bitch
Everything about me solid
Burberry nigga them be my drawers
Alexander McQueen in closets
Swagged Out Ken yeah nigga I'm Puff uhh
Have that pussy throbbin' 
Someone tell me where the drugs at
I'm into that twistin' off them molly caps
Ciroc dude don't fuck with Goose
Can I get a shot swim in ya juice?
Worth a stack a minute everyday that shit repeat
I ain't trying to sweep you off ya feet
Here til ya see ya travesty now

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
All I all I all I all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me make an excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything
that corrodes inside of me 
I see you joke and while you laugh don't you feel bad
I'll probably sleep and never ever wake up
never ever wake up never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

More more bloody more we gon' drink this muhfucka down
More bottoms up then we pass it round more
Fill it up more, not enough more
Bloody more we gon drink this muhfucka down more
Bottoms up then we pass it round more
Fill it up more, not enough more
Fill it up more, not enough more
Fill it up more, not enough more</pre>

Song:   Collect Calls *
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

* iTunes bonus track

[Intro: Kent Jamz]
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Momma take this motherfuckin block off
Tryna reach you every day, collect calls
Never get through when I go through withdrawals
Say who told you that I wanted this door
to slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
ask you if you can give me your rent for
a attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yeah every rack is yours
Commissary runnin low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K-Dot wrote me sayin Marcus got killed
If you know me then you know how bad I feel
Keisha prove me wrong and never came to visit
And I heard she fuckin on some other nigga
And my niggaz left me in the dark, blind
Momma just get back at me this last time

[Chorus: Kent Jamz]
Men lie, w-women lie
Men lie, w-women...
Men lie, w-women lie
Men lie, w-women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Momma take this motherfuckin block off
What's on the date one day I take the block off
Pulled up and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, this ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talkin to your only son
'Member when you put me in that relay run?
I was racin, chasin dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me same support
Investigation sayin that the same report
from a witness just might testify in court
D.A. say I take a deal or take a loss
I ain't built for all them God damn numbers
God's will, say a prayer for me momma
If you can't then open up the phone lines
Momma just get back at me this last time

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Dante, if I stress to take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I can only help but do so much
Betterin yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection, tell me who you see
Who is your protection? G-O-D
No it's not neglection, I have just accepted
your fate and what it's gon' be
'Member all the nights that I cried
thinking that my only son just died?
Peeking through the window, kicking through the door
It's you they looking for, raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this

[Chorus]

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Black Hippy
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   The Recipe (Black Hippy Remix) *
Typed by: kill4747@hotmail.com

* Available only on the Spotify Deluxe Edition

[Sample from "Meet The Frownies" by Twin Sister]
"Smoking weed with you
cause you've taught me to"  - - > Andrea Estella (*Repeats throughout the entire song*) 

[Ab-Soul] 
Fuck Black Hippy, nigga
I invented the recipe

It's a beautiful day, I guess
For a bitch to roll with Ab-Soul, I guess
Pretty chick, let me see them breasts
E.T. OG from the weed clinic (Soulo!)
Solo, but I'm never alone (That's right)
I stay high and I'm powerful (Soulo!)
Westside! (Easy call) 
I got three eyes, man, I see y'all
All I do is kill shit, ICU
Party with a few girls at USC
It's eight-two degrees and my top off, and they top off
I'm getting topped off (Soul!) Top Dawg
Women, weed, and weather, what more can I say?
"To live and die in LA"
"Spend a week on Venice Beach"
I'm 2Pac AND Biggie Smalls
 
[ScHoolboy Q]
Every mornin', nigga, I get blazed, aye (Yeah!)
Women, weed, and weather, nigga, if you bored, come and join the wave, aye (Yeah!)
Girl, what is your name? Cause I'm feeling your frame, can I see what you bout? Uh!
A little somethin' in your rear, little somethin' in your mouth 
little somethin' on your couch, uh! Know what I'm talkin' about? 
Bring the coffin out
Cause I killed it, I done drilled it
She said she like it from the back like a real bitch, uh!
She swallowed my pride, I damn near cried
Yo, I can't reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes
but when you got the recipe, it's no surprise
Bad hoes panties get left behind, I want your behind and
 
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Dr. Dre)
You might catch me in Atlanta lookin' like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-town, I be really pimpin'
but nothin' like my hometown, I'm forever livin'
Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA
 
[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some 
three W's only for a three day run, bitch!
Take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit!
I be livin' in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
"Ribbon in the Sky" on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California livin' 'till I am old
You want to be on to peak on the chart
so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon cause she on the BS before we can start, uh!

Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know I'm priority 
Order me Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy, he on his job, boy, he sure be havin' the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale the pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controllin' my vice
No way, hell no, uh-uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be on to peak on the chart
so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
that it's eight-two degrees and my top peeled off
 
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Dr. Dre)
You might catch me in Atlanta lookin' like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-town, I be really pimpin'
but nothin' like my hometown, I'm forever livin'
Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to
 
[Jay Rock]
Jay Rock got the recipe, fly hoes wanna roll, I guess (I guess)
Everybody know I got that yola (yola), ask Keisha, she'll confess (Huh!)
I wake up, then I bake up with a bad bitch, she ain't got on no make up, uh!
Medicated, geez, my nigga, no tellin' where the high gonna take us, uh
Three w's, I'm at The W, she got double D's bout to bring trouble through
OG, Hennessy get their panties wet, I'm tryin' to +dive in the swimmin' pool+
Left stroke, right stroke, what's the best stroke?
That stroke can smoke all down her throat
and we blows all kinds of dro
Cali got the best so act like you know, nigga!
 
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Dr. Dre)
You might catch me in Atlanta lookin' like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-town, I be really pimpin'
But nothin' like my hometown I'm forever livin'
Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA (*Echoes*)</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Jay-Z
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe (Remix)
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar + female singer]
I am a sinner, who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me, things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone.. bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music, I would share it but today 
I'm yellin' "Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my VIBE; bitch, don't kill my vibe"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Hol' up - Trinidad James in four weeks but now my album platinum and shit
So what? Y'all keep the numbers 
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga, this courtesy of Compton (courtesy of Compton)
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker, love me on the east like I'm Chuck D, dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin to be the God MC, you look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there - I'm fuckin this industry hard
I'm baggin this money, tea-baggin your honey, you'd thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're lightweight, they tell me you nice and I'm like "wait!"
Go get me a knife, you're lookin like steak" and when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And where the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher but we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase, I know you heard me nigga, this is a burpee nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now homie, I'm in extra vibe
Pipe down on the curve when you heard that I got these words to the upper echelon, that's excell-ant

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Up in the clouds, me and my spouse..
Rumors on the ground gettin too loud, please turn them shits down (down, DOWN...)
Can't hear myself think, turbulence, shit, I almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink, runnin through that bitch like it's my house, all up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball, no I don't 'member you, I don't intend to 
empty my, memory, bank, it's a +Million Dollars+ in it, +Baby+, Hilary Swank
Sittin next to Hilary smellin like dank, presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll WAIT... {*echoes*} ...
I've been in my wave like twenty years straight, I've been on my vibe like twenty years straight
Don't fuck up my high (fuck up my high) nights like this, I could fuck up a pie and still be skraight (still be skraight) 
Fall back bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath.. I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint {*inhales*} smokin' this shit like I'm tryna prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno, kill my, vibe, that's your motherfuckin funeral {*laughs*}

[Kendrick Lamar]
Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggaz pissed off
I'm in this lil' 'dition shit, envision my fort
Leader of the new school, on my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be +Black Swan+?
World in my palms, ironically, I am the Globetrotters' best cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was 16 that I'd write a 16 to put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with 16, should have been in the pen but now my pen writin' with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends, I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was runnin for dear life but now I'm runnin the map, bitch, I'm here NIGGA~!
Picture little old me givin a fuck from what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or hit a Suburban, nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent but I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like BLAP! Mini-14 like BLAP! Empty out another magazine like BLAP!
Hit a young nigga, get BACK! (DOO!) I kill 'em all when they try to kill my VIBE! (DOO! DOO!)
I am the bad, the good guy, the last the hood got, the last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a ten second drum solo, bitch see you at Woodstock, AH!</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   Swimming Pool (Drank) (Extended)
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro/Interlude]
Pour up (drank) head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank) stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank) wake up (drank)
Faded (drank) faded (drank)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
that I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd move
Changin' by the minute, and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Interlude]

[Kendrick Lamar]
"Okay, now open your mind up and listen to me Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now, and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick"
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice, then apparently
I'm over-influenced by what you are doin', I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Kendrick Lamar - repeat 2X]
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one-hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you, bang?
Two chopper, two-hundred shots, bang

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Kendrick Lamar]
{"Sherane..."}
Pool full of liquor then you dive in, in, in, in {*reversed*}
{"Sherane, Sherane, Sherane..."}
W-watch 'em all f-flock (aww man) 
{"Sherane..."} Girls wanna play, play, play
(Where is she takin' me?)
P-pool full of liquor, I'ma d-i-i-iive in it
(Where is she takin', me?)

All I, all I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
is in the bottom, of the bottle, and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release, everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep 
and never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ George Clinton, Thundercat
Album:  To Pimp a Butterfly
Song:   Wesley's Theory
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

{Sample of "Every Nigger is a Star" by Boris Gardiner fades in}
"Every nigger is a star, every nigger is a star
 Every nigger is a star, every nigger is a star
 Every nigger is a star
 Who will deny that you and I and every nigger is a star?"

[Intro: George Clinton]
HIT ME~!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hopin that you'll survive
Gather your wind, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize? To pimp a butterfly

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin of you
...Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

[Kendrick Lamar]
When I get signed, homie I'ma ack a fool
Hit the dance flo', strobe lights in the room
Snatch ya lil' secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce four
Platinum on er'rythang, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton Swap Meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the Pres with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated but I got a million-dollar check, like that

[Thundercat]
We should never gave, we should never gave
you niggaz money, go back home, money go back home
We should never gave, we should never gave
you niggaz money, go back home, money go back home
(Everybody get UUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPP!!!!)

[Chorus]


({*beep*} "Yo wassup? It's Dre
 Remember the first time you came out to the house?
 You said you wanted a spot like mine
 But remember, anybody can get it
 The hard part is keepin it, motherfucker~!")

[Kendrick Lamar]
What you want? You a house? You a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts? (Aw man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators, cliche and say fuck your haters
I can see the bottle in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin you
Because you make me live forever baby, count it all together baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you get the White House, do you
But remember you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe yo' ass befo' thirty-five

[George Clinton] (Kendrick Lamar)
Yeah, lookin down is quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop!)
Lookin good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it!)
You got a medal for us, leavin miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you CROSS my mind!

[Thundercat]
We should never gave, we should never gave
you niggaz money, go back home, money go back home
We should never gave, we should never gave
you niggaz money, go back home, money go back home

(Tax man comin, tax man comin, tax man comin, TAX MAN COMIN!!!)</pre>

[Intro: woman cussing Kendrick out]
FUCK you, motherfucker! You a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga you ain't shit
Walkin around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty eight-inch - you playin!
I shouldn't be fuckin with you anyway, I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
Youse an off-brand ass nigga, err'body know it, your homies know it
Everybody fuckin know, fuck you nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gon' lose on a good bitch
My +OTHER+ nigga... is on, you off! What the fuck is really going on?

[Kendrick Lamar - in spoken word style]
This... dick... ain't... freeeeee!
You lookin at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet, eatin your leftovers and raw meat
This... dick... ain't... freeeeee!
Livin in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This... dick... ain't... freeeeee~!
I mean, baby, you really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents
Hell fuckin nawww - this dick... ain't... freeeee!
I need forty acres and a mule, not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit, matador, matador, had the door knockin
Let 'em in, who's that? Genital's best friend
This... dick... ain't... freeeeee!
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin pornos in poverty - apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggystyle shall help
This dick... ain't... freeeeee!
Matter fact it need interest, matter fact it's nine inches
Matter fact see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin, my consensus
Been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion, my check with less endorsement
left me dormant, dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think, it's in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
Now my dick ain't free!

Song:   King Kunta
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a bone to pick...
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again!
(Ay, ay nigga, what's happenin' nigga? K-Dot back in the hood, nigga)
I'm mad {he mad!} but I ain't stressin'
... True friends, one question

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Anna Wise)
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta - everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta - black man takin' no losses {aw yeah!}
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta - everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams (what's the yams?)

[Kendrick Lamar] + (Anna Wise)
... The yam is the power that be {*echoes*}
... You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can!) I can dig rappin'
... But a rapper with a ghostwriter, what the fuck happened?
(Oh no!) ... I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of y'all share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (a two-man cell)
Somethin's in the water {somethin's in the water}
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
... The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor {*echoes*}
... Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
... 24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemies and say

[Chorus] - minus last bar line

{"You goat-mouthed mammyfucker!"}

[Kendrick Lamar]
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they don't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done to be honest
And I put that on my mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo~!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king

Bitch where was you when I was- {*gunshot*}
{"By the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be within you"}
{*gunshot*} Now I run the game got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta - everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta - black man takin' no losses (aw yeah!)
Bitch where was you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta - everybody wanna cut the legs off him...

[Outro: Anna Wise]
{"Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk"}
We want the funk! We want the funk!
{"Now if I give you the funk, you gon', take it?"}
We want the funk!
{"Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?"}
We want the funk!
{"Now if I give you the funk, you gon', take it?"}
We want the funk! {"Do you want the funk?"}
We want the funk! {"Do you want the funk?"}
We want the funk!

Album:  To Pimp a Butterfly
Song:   Institutionalized
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
What money got to do with it
when I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin back for a visit
Hol' up, get it back...
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I can still kill me a nigga, so what?

[Interlude: Anna Wise and Bilal]
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent, free my homies and 'nem
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get hiiiiigh, Lord
Who ever thought, Massa'll take the chains off me?

{*beat changes*}

Zoom zoom zoom-zoom-zoom, zoom-zoom-zoom
Zoom zoom zoom-zoom-zoom, zoom-zoom-zoom
Zoom zoom zoom-zoom-zoom, zoom-zoom-zoom
Zoom zoom zoom-zoo-(Sheeeeiiit~!)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Life can be like, a box of choc-o-late
Quid pro quo, somethin for somethin, that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just, alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose-intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
BE all you can be, true, but the problem is
A dream's only a dream if, work, don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm prol'ly just way too loyal
K-Dizzle would do it for you, my niggaz think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged...
But somethin came over you once I took you to them fuckin BET Awards
You lookin at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of 'em
Somebody told me you thinkin 'bout snatchin jewelry
I shoulda listened what my grandmomma said to me...

[Chorus: Bilal]
Shit don't change until you, get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you, get up and wash yo' ass (Boooy...)
Shit don't change until you, get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now... slow down

[Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot somethin, God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said

[Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck am I s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin licks?
The constant big money talk about mansions and foreign whips
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models stiffen up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin dick, fuck is this?
One more suck away from wavin flashy wrist
My defense, mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?
No more livin poor, meet my .44
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin it back to the poor?
Well that's me at these awards (I guess my grandmomma was warnin a boy, she said...)

[Chorus]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot somethin, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't
take the hood out the homie, took his show money
Stashed it in the mozey-wozey, Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service</pre>

{"I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
  Sometimes I did the same"}

{*woman moaning and groaning*}

"If these walls could talk...
 If these walls could talk...
 If these walls could talk...
 If these walls could talk...
 If these walls could talk..
 IF THESE WALLS COULD TAL-L-L-L-K-" Sex.

[Anna Wise]
She just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you...
Exercise your right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true....
Shout out to the birthday girls, say hey! (hey!) Say hey! (hey!)
{"Aw girl~!"} Everyone deserves a night to play (play)
She plays - only when you tell her no

[Chorus: Anna Wise] (Bilal)
If these walls could talk
(I can feel your reign/rain when it cries, gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk
(I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it, ohh) Ohh...

[Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls can talk, they'd tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall tellin me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I'm just a tenant...
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean it's still amazing, before they couldn't stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might (*CRUSH*)

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls can talk, they'd tell me to go deep
Yellin at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that's my religion
Walls feelin like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on these streets too long
...Lookin at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved, I'd rather diss them
I'd rather call.. on you, put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon' (*CRUSH*)

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls can talk, they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash 'em on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall tellin you that commissary is low
Race wars happenin, no callin CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull-like - a killer that turned snitch
Walls is tellin me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hopin the warden would afford them
...(THAT SENTENCE SO IMPORTANT)
Walls tellin you to listen to "Sing About Me"
Retaliation is strong, you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusin my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently servin life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin on a famous rapper
(WALLS CAN TALK, TALK... {*echoes*})

{"I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
 Sometimes I did the same, abusing my power full of resentment
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression
 Found myself screaming in a hotel room"}</pre>

(AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!)
...(AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!)
...(AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!)

[Chorus]
Lovin you is complicate-AHHED!!!
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicate-AHHED!!
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicate-AHHED!
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated

[Kendrick Lamar]
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
confidence in yourself, breakin on marble floors
Watchin anonymous strangers tellin me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your tolerance nothin special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
situation had stopped with your little sister bakin
A baby inside, just a teenager, where's your patience?
Where's your antennas, where is the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin tell you, you fuckin failure, YOU AIN'T NO LEADER!
I never liked you, forever despise you, I DON'T NEED YOU!
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I fuckin hate you, I hope you embrace it, I swear...

[Chorus]
Lovin you is complicate-AHHED!!!
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicate-AHHED!!
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicate-AHHED!
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you, lovin you, not lovin you, one hundred proof!

("I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me...
 Yes, I hate you too")

{*music stops then slows down, Spanish hotel worker knocks on door*}

"Lovin you is complicated, what I got to to do to get to you? To get to you?"

[Kendrick Lamar - in drunk, cracky voice]
Are you the reason why momma and 'nem leavin?
No you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was yo' presence, where was yo' support that you pretend?
You ainât no brother, you ainât no disciple, you ainât no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend
Lil' brother, you promised you'd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven
You even Facetimed instead of a hospital visit
You should thought he would recover well...
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding, for real
Then he died, God himself will say "You fuckin failed! You ain't try!"

{*sniffling*}

I know yo' secrets nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin on yo' heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin, nigga
Y'all damn near beefin, I seen it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk {*deep swig*}
I cry myself to sleep, bitch everything is your fault
Faults breakin to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know yo' secrets, don't let me tell them to the world
about that shit you thinkin, and that time you- {*swig*} I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think yo' heart made of bulletproof
Shoulda killed yo' ass a long time ago
You shoulda felt that black Revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk, it would say "You GOTTA go!!"
And if I told your secrets, the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness</pre>

[Intro]
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga!
Alls my life I... Hard times like, "God!"
Bad trips like, "God~!" Nazareth
I'm fucked up, homie you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me? Do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me? Do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin at you from the face down
When Mac-11 even boom with the bass down - SCHEMIN!
And let me tell you 'bout MY life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reapin everything I sow, so my karma come
And heaven, no preliminary hearing, so my record
And my motherfuckin gang stands silence for the record, uih!
Tell the world, I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone crazy
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Chorus]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ]
Wouldn't you know, we been hurt, been down before... nigga!
When our pride was low, lookin at the world like, "Where do we go?"... nigga!
And we HATE po-po, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure... nigga!
I'm at the preacher's door, my knees gettin weak
and my gun might blow, but we gon' be alright

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
What you want? You a house? You a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see, my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can LIVE at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know when it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin of my partner put the candy painted on the Regal
Diggin in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico -- ah~!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool
If I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all
I rap, I black on track and rest assured
My rights, my wrongs I write 'til I'm right with God

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Outro]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin me is complicated, too afraid a lot of changes
I'm alright and you're a favorite, dark nights in my prayers

{"I remembered you was conflicted, misusing your influence
  Sometimes I did the same, abusing my power full of resentment
  Resentment that turned into a deep depression
  Found myself screamin in the hotel room
  I didn't wanna self-destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
  ...So I went runnin' for answers"}</pre>

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhhhhhhhh-ohhh
Ohhhhh-ohhh-ohhh (Oooh, do-doo-do-doo-loo-doo-do-do)
(Wee-oooh) Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhhhhhhhh-ohhh
Ohhhhh-ohhh-{*heavy breathing*}

 What's wrooooong, nigga?
 I thought you was keepin it gaaaangsta?
 I thought this what you waaaaanted?
 They say if you scared, go to church
 But remember... he knows the bible, too

[Chorus]
My baby when I getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smokin, loc'n, pokin the doja 'til I'm idle with you
Cause I (want yoooooou....)
Now baby when I'm ridin here, I'm ridin dirty
Registration is out of service
Smokin, loc'n, drinkin the potion, you can see me swervin
Cause I (want yoooooou.... - I want you more than you know)

[Kendrick Lamar - spoken word style]
I remember you took me to the mall last week ba-BAAAAY!
You looked me in my eyes 'bout fo' or five times
'Til I was hypnotized then you clarified that I (want yoooooou....)
You said Sherane ain't got nothin on Lucy, I said you cra-ZAY~!
Roses are red violets are blue, but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want yoooooou....)

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
You said to me...
You said your name was Lucy
I said, "Where's Ricardo?" You said, "Oh no, not the show"
Then you spit a lil' rap to me like this when I turned 26 I was like, "Oh shit~!"
You said to me - I remember what you said, too - you said,
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
 Usually I donât do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
 Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
 About these rappers I came after when they was boring
 Lucy gon' fill your pockets, Lucy gon' move your momma
 out of Compton inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
 Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoidin me?
 It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
 Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder
 Lucy gon' call ya even when Lucy know you love your Father
 I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album
 Truly, Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
 Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
 Lucy got paper work on top of paper work I want..
 you to know that Lucy got you, all your life I watched you
 And now you all grown up then sign this contract if thatâs possible"

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhhhhhhhh-ohhh
Ohhhhh-ohhh-ohhh (Oooh, do-doo-do-doo-loo-doo-do-do)
(Wee-oooh) Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhhhhhhhh-ohhh
Ohhhhh-ohhh-ohhh, ohhhhh-ohh-ohhh
Da-da-da-doom-du-dah-dah-day-um-die-yi-yiiiigh
Yigh...yi...yi...yi...yay...

{"I remembered you was conflicted, misusing your influence
  Sometimes I did the same, abusing my power full of resentment

[Intro]
Oh SHIT~! I need that, I need dat sloppy, that sloppy (Yo...)
Like a Chevy in quicksand... Yeah, that sloppy

("So it seeeeeeeeems...")

[Kendrick Lamar]
This feeling is unmatched
This feeling is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap (West, West, West...)
We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, West, West...)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimickin radio's nemesis may be wack
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
the mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin scratchin dilligent sentences backwards
Visitin freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin Benjamin benefits, sinnin in traffic
Spinnin women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin in, every decision, Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it, lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin rappers, finish your fraction while writin blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that? The fact it brought me back home

[Chorus]
We been waitin for you, Waitin for you
Waitin for you, waitin for... you

[Kendrick Lamar]
I know everything... I know everything, know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you, I know everything
I know Compton, I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history, I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well that's God's decision
I know you know that lines from Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, donât gossip about how it was distributed
I know how... people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin how much itâs worth
I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didnât know shit, the day I came home

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin new laws momma passed on home trainin
He looked at me and said, "Kendrick you do know my language
 You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
 Oh I forgot, +Don't Kill My Vibe+, that's right, you're famous
 I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
 But never mind, you're here right now don't you mistake it
 It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
 Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress
 And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil
 You spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
 I can attempt, to enlighten you without frightenin you
 If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
 But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace
 Then be an advocate, tell your homies especially to come back home"

{*beat stops then changes*}

This is a Woooooorld Premier (This is a World Premier...)
This is a Woooooorld Premier (This is a World Premier...)
(This is a World Premier...)

[Kendrick Lamar]
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me somethin, got me losin my mind - AHH~!!
You make me wanna jump (JUMP, JUMP. JUMP, JUMP)
{Let's talk about love...} (JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP)
{Let's talk about love...} (JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP) AHH!!
{Let's talk about love...} (JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP) AHH!! AHH-AHH!!
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me somethin, think I'm losin my mind, ha!
I say where you at, from the front to the back
I'm lookin for you I react, only when you react
Ha, I thought I found you, back in the ghet-to
When I was seventeen with the .38 spec-ial
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel {*song starts to fade*}
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway, I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is...</pre>

[Intro]
"K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
 Every time I call, it's goin to voice mail...
 Don't TELL me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga!
 No socks and skinny jeans and shit, hah!
 Hahahahahahahahahaha! ...Call me on Shaniqua's phone"

(Woo-WOO-WOO-WOO-WOO...)

[Chorus]
I been A1 since day one, you niggaz boo-boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from - boo-boo
Lil' hoes you went to school with - boo-boo
Baby mama and your new bitch - boo-boo!
We was in the hood, fourteen with the deuce-deuce
Fourteen years later goin hard, like we used to
on the dead homies... on the dead homies....

[Kendrick Lamar]
I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
My lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
FUCK what they talkin 'bout, yo' shit is where it's at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck yo' fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, yo' hood, yo' name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin to the scripts, now hip, them Benjamins gon' cuddle up
Skip - hop - drip - drop
Flip - flop with the white tube sock
It goes ("Sherrrrm Sticks, burrrrrrn this")
That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton Zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they FUCK with you
Asians, they FUCK with you, nobody can't FUCK with you

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called, they said, "The enemies done cliqued up"
Oh YEAH? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh YEAH? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh YEAH? Everything is everything, it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin, scramblin, football numbers slanderin
Niggaz name on paper, you snitched all summer
Streets don't fail me now...
They tell me it's a new gang in town....
From Compton - to Congress, set trippin all around
Ain't nothin' new but a flow of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs, make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it Do?"
(OBAMA SAY WHAT IT DO... OBAMA SAY WHAT IT DO)

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody wanna talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white and who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y'all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don't ask about no camera blockin at award shows
No don't ask about my bitch, no don't ask about my foes
'Less you askin me about power, yeah I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby âK. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up
 Pandora's box, I box 'em all in, by a landslide"
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sittin down with Jay
He said "It's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"

[Outro]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggaz boo-boo

{"I remembered you was conflicted, misusing your influence
  Sometimes I did the same, abusing my power full of resentment
  Resentment that turned into a deep depression
  Found myself screamin in the hotel room
  I didn't wanna self-destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
  ...So I went runnin for answers, until I came home
  But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
  Going back and forth, trying to convince my self the stripes I earned
  Or maybe how A1 my foundation was
  But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war back in the city
  I was entering a new one"}</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ James Fauntleroy, Ronald Isley
Album:  To Pimp a Butterfly
Song:   How Much a Dollar Cost?
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin once I park this luxury car
Hoppin out feeling big as Mutombo, twenty on pump six dirty
Marcellus called me Dumbo twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend 'em a ear or two, how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept that what men'll do
Twenty-oh-six, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu, my American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station, a homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten rand, stressin about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin
He begged and pleaded, asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it" contributin money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you - nothin less, nothin more"
I told him I ain't have it then closed my door, tell me how much a dollar cost

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
All you neeeeed... is more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need the air you breathe

[Kendrick Lamar]
He's starin at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin, he's starin at me, I grab my key
He's starin at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin told me to keep it in park until I can see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin ME for a favor
He's starin at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
Cause now I'm starin back at him, feelin some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin at his neck
I never understood someone beggin for goods
Askin for handouts, takin it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin at me for the longest until he finally asked
"Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
 'A humble man is all that we ever need', tell me how much a dollar cost"

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Guilt trippin and feelin resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin
Sour emotions got me lookin at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin all the time
I got better judgment, I know when niggaz hustlin
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin, I did compromise
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine
reekin from your skin, moonshine and gin
Nigga you're babblin, your words ain't flatterin, I'm imaginin
Denzel but lookin at O'Neal, +Kazaam+ your sad thrills
Your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
 You're lookin at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
 The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve
 Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
 The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God"

[Outro: Ronald Isley]
I wash my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone (oh yeah...)
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs</pre>

Album:  To Pimp a Butterfly
Song:   Compelxion (A Zulu Love)
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro]
I'm with this...

[Chorus] (Pete Rock)
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Ooooooooh complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh...
Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
...Sneak (dissin!)
Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill witcha
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if massa listenin, cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh....
Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the morning sun
Brown-skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your momma can't run
...Sneak (dissin!)
Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill witcha
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if massa listenin, I got the world's attention
So I'mma say somethin that's vital and critical for survival
of mankind, if he lyin, color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces, then wit told me,
"A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came from God then you was my confirmation, I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
You like it, I love it {8X}

(Woo-WOO-WOO-WOO-WOO)

(Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
 I need you to speak yo' mind real quick, loved one!)

[Rapsody]
Let me talk my Stu Scott, 'scuse me on my 2Pac
+Keep Your Head Up+, when did you stop... loving thy...
color of your skin, color of your eyes?
That's the real +Blue's+, baby, like you met Jay's baby
Uh... you blew me away
You think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, +12 Years a Slave+
12 years of age, thinkin my shade too dark
+I love myself+, I no longer need Cu-pid
Enforcin my dark side like a young George Lu-cas
Light don't mean you smart, bein dark don't make you stu-pid
And frame of mind for them +Bustas+, ain't talkin +WOO-HAH~!+
Need a paradox for the pair of daughters they tutored
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times
If you don't see you're beautiful in your complexion
It ain't complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, uh that's the context
Yeah, baby, I'm conscious, ain't no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain't no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain't talkin Jay, mm-mmm, I ain't talkin B
I'm talkin +Daze+ we got +School+ watchin movie screens
And +Spike+ your self esteem, the new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it's all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain't a thing

{"Barefoot babies with no cares...
 Teenage gun toters that don't play fair, should I get out the car?...
 I don't see Compton, I see something much worse
 The land of the landmines, the hell that's on earth}</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Assassin
Album:  The Blacker the Berry {S}
Song:   The Blacker the Berry
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro]
Everything black, I don't want black
I don't like e'rything black, ain't need black
Some white, some black, I ain't want black
I hate e'rything black, black
Ohh now we black, I don't need black
I don't like e'rything black, I don't need black
I'll die we black, I ain't on black
I want everything black

[Kendrick Lamar - singing]
Six in the morn', fire in the street
Burn baby burn, that's all I wan' see
And sometimes I get off watchin you die in vain
It's such a shame, they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin
But homie you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga
(My nigga, my nigga, my nigga, my nigga)
(My nigga, my nigga, my nigga, my nigga)

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American
I'm African, I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you? You hate my people
Your plan is to terminate my culture, you're fuckin evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin my feelings - I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community makin a killin
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Interlude]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Chorus: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip? Left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All dem a say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the Black
Just remember that

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizin that I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalize, manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you? I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout
Ah, black and successful, this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm makin a killin?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American
I'm African, I'm black as the heart of a fuckin Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you, no fuck y'all! That's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you? You hate my people
I can tell cause it's threats when I see you, I can tell cause your way's deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-day
Or eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
when gang bangin make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!</pre>

Album:  To Pimp a Butterfly
Song:   You Ain't Gotta Lie (Momma Said)
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro]
Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, y'all let flies in this muh'fucker!
Close that door! My OG up in this muh'erfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle in his hand, ackin a fool
Hey, hey, babe check it out, I'ma tell you what my mama had said, she like..

[Kendrick Lamar]
I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name

[Bridge]
Askin where the hoes at to impress me
Askin where the moneybags to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin where the plug at to impress me
Askin where the jug at to impress me
Askin where it's at only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard

[Kendrick Lamar]
...And the world don't respect you
and the culture don't accept you but you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex)
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context

[Chorus + Bridge]

[Kendrick Lamar]
...What do you got to offer?
Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin, been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggaz be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi, niggaz and bitches
who make habitual lyin babies, bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me, you can never relate me
to him (him), to her (her), or that (that) or them (them)
Or you (you), the truth (truth) you love (love) to bend (bend)
In the back (back), in the bed (bed), on the floor, that's yo' ho
On the couch (couch), in her mouth (mouth), I'll be out, really doe
See loud, rich niggaz got low money
And loud, broke niggaz got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel

[Chorus]</pre>

[Intro]
"We got a young brother that STANDS for something!
 We got a young brother that believes in all of us!
 Brother Kendrick Lamar! He's not a rapper, he's a writer!
 He's an author! And if you read between the lines,
 we'll learn how to love one another! But you can't do that!
 I said you can't do that without loving yourself fir-"

(This is a wooooorld premier! This is a wooooorld premier!)

[Kendrick Lamar]
I done been through a whole lot
Trials, tribulations but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bowtie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yea-yay!
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But ain't no nigga gon' never drown me
In front of a dirty double mirror they found me and...

[Chorus]
I love myself!
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs)
I love myself!
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself!
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love my...self!
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody lookin at you crazy (crazy!)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
..Lift up yo' head and keep movin
or let the paranoia haunt you
Peace to fashion, police, I wear my heart
on my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times our potential was anonymous?
How many times the city makin me promises?
So I promise this

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
They wanna say it's a war outside and a bomb in the street
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police
In Iraq, on the corner, in a line full of fiends
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme
Yep... these days are frustration, keep y'all on tuck and rotation
I duck these cold faces, post up fe-fi-fo-fum basis
Dreams are reality's peace (Ho-hey!)
Blow steam in the face of the beast
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now
The stronger me'll still smile

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Walk - my - bare - feet (Walk - my - bare - feet)
Down - down - valley - deep (Down - down - valley - deep) {I love myself!}
Fe - fi - fo - fum (Fe - fi - fo - fum) {I love myself!}
My - heart - un - done (My - heart - un - done)

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I went to war last night...
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right
I went to war last night...
I've been dealin with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin every other blessings, I can never see the message
I can never take the lead, I can never bob and weave
For my nigga they be lettin 'em annihilate me
And the sounds that I'm movin in at meteor speed
Finna run into a building, let my body in the streets
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my momma know I'm free
Give my story to the children and a lesson they can read
And a glory to the feeling of the audience scenes
Send 'em up, make a motherfucker scream - I LOVE MYSELF~!

[Outro]
I lost my head, I must misread what the Good Book said
Oh woes be me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry, i...</pre>

Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro]
Ohhh-whooooa, ohhhhhh
Whoooooa, yeeeeah
Yeeeah, yeeeah, yeeeah, yeeeah

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh.. yeah, uh

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan (one-two, one-two)
Uh, when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Do you believe in me? Are you deceivin' me?
Could I let you down easily? Is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K. Lamar
or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that...

[Kendrick Lamar]
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be there first?
Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretendin'?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in? Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dustin' your shoulders from bein' offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissin'?
What kind of bridge did they burn? Revenge on your mind when it's mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-makin' seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The voice of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you ridin' with me, nigga..

[Kendrick Lamar]
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analyzin', that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow?
Murphy's Law, generation X, will I ever be your X?
Floss off a baby step, mauled by the mouth of pitbulls, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, itâs respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shooter, you assassin?
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh I know, it's Michael Jackson
Oh when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us "Billie Jean", you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my words be your earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you ridin' with me nigga, let me ask this question, nigga

[Intro: male]
Come here, girl
Oh you want me to touch you right there?
Ohh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Ahahah, oh you want it? 
Oh you want it right now? Like that? 
Ah, I got you baby
Ahahah, all on you baby
Ahahah, push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy baby
Ahahahahaha...

[Kendrick Lamar]
I seen it vividly joggin' my brain memory
Life no, I seen it vividly joggin' my brain memory
Life no longer infinity, this was the final callin'
No birds chirpin' or flyin', no dogs barkin'
We all nervous and cryin', movin' in caution
In disbeliefs our beliefs the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, crackin' and crumblin'
The ground is shakin', swallowin' young woman
With a baby, daisies and other flowers burnin' in destruction
The smell is disgustin', the heat is unbearable
Preachers touchin' on boys run for cover, the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust, famous screamin' in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes fallin' out the sky
Trains jumpin' off the track, mothers yellin' "He's alive!"
Backpedalin' Christians settlin' for forgiveness
Evidence all around us, the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burnin' more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happenin') No more runnin' from world wars
(It's happenin') No more discriminatin' the poor
(It's happenin') No more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishin' for green and gold, the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly, a moniker of war 
from Heaven that played the symphony, thunder like number four
Then I heard "What have you did for me?" I fell to my knees
Pulled out my resume that dated back to June 17th
1987, my paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes, pray to God that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to Hell
Geez Louise, I thought you said that I'd excel
I made "To Pimp a Butterfly" for you
Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you, say I didn't try for you
Say I didn't ride for you, I tithed for you
I pushed the club to the side for you, who love you like I love you? ...
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'ma start jottin' everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me, always camaraderie
I can see our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearin' the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm runnin' in place tryin' to make it to church...

[Outro]
Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo' cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
Just take it all back before the light switch</pre>

[Intro]
Pimp pimp~! (Hooray!)
Pimp pimp~! (Hooray! Hooray!)
Pimp pimp~! (Hooray!)
Pimp pimp~!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm sick and tired of bein' tired, can't pick a side, the Gemini
Prophesize if we livin', I, promise momma not to feel no lie
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy, hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast, can you please pray for me?
Get God on the phone, said it won't be long
I see jiggaboos, I see styrofoams
My hood goin' brazy, where did we go wrong?
I see jiggaboos, I see styrofoams
Get Top on the phone

[Kendrick Lamar]
Tell the squad come home
We gon' ball again, 'fore he call us home
World is goin' brazy, where did we go wrong?
It's a tidal wave, it's a thunderdome
Get God on the phone, I just got a raise (I just got a raise)
Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me) diamonds all appraised (diamonds all appraised)
And I'm bossin' up (and I'm bossin' up) bitch get out the way (bitch get out the way)
I'm the only way, we can fornicaaaate
Ah, pimpin' and posin', look what I drove in
Ah, havin' these hoes and, I know that I'm chosen
Ah, I live by the code and, me and my bros and
Ah, my dollars ain't foldin', you was never the homie

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
(What's up, my nigga?) Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision
All mornin' with the mixed dashboards triple digits, parallel park like an alien, can't visit
Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches, find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick
{"Hello Billy"} ...
So many plays on me I finesse, palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary, this the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil, a father figure, fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he'll kill you himself, TDE the mafia of the West
Move in silence, yeah we juugin' like that, act of violence, yeah we juugin' like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past, Lord forgive me, hopin' I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new 911, almost thought I'd seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren, Rock-a-lock about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son drippin' in gold, Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm about to let my hair down on hoes, top billin', that's a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul, might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year, Mackwop bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two, I'm not done, 2Teez told me that I'm the one
I can put a rapper on life support, guarantee that's somethin' none of you want
Ten homies down and they all servin' life, water's like twenty-five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt? What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch I get buck, I'm as real as they come, shit is amazin', I'm feedin' my cravings
You know that you want me, come here now lil' baby, I'm fuckin', I'm crazy
Servin' it like I belong in the basement, or live at the Days Inn
Yan Yan my relative, black cherry soda, pistol and poverty, come get to know us
Get Top on the phone {*echoes*}

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Who doin' the drums?
Man put that nigga on the drums man
Yep all day, "Mortal Man" and "Kunta"
Alright, from the top!</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar] + (Anna Wise)
(What did the Asian say?) A peace of mind
That's what the Asian said, I need a divine
intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believin' in Buddha, me believin' in God
Asked him "What are you doin'?", he said "Takin' my time
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinkin' too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?"
(What did the Indian say?) A piece of land
That's what the Indian said, I needed demand
Tellin' me longevity's in the dirt, should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed
(Now what the black man say?) A piece of pussy
That's what the black man said I needed to push me
to the limit to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a wool, we like to live in the jungle
Like to play in the peach, what you sayin' to me?
He said "Nigga come back to reality for a week"
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it
(What the white man say?) A piece of mine's
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Tellin' me that he sellin' me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rappin', I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losin' your core followin' gainin' it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist, if I don't target your market
If you ain't signin' your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are givin' their demo all in the toilet
You work toward your master's mortgage
I need a piece

[Chorus 2X: Bilal]
I holler, "What you DO? What you SAY?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar + SZA]
They say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
(Tell 'em when you went to the park and everybody came back and...)
And welfare don't mean well for you, you, you, you
(What about when you tried to do a side for that but you...)
They tell me that my bill's past due, due, due, due, uhh {due due due due due}
(Talk about the charge you got...)
And preacher man don't always tell the truth, truth, truth, truth
{Do you believe in God? If you don't, it's cool}

[SZA] + (Kendrick) + {Jay Rock}
(But) Head is the answer, head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
(Don't tell them when you second guess yourself)
(I need you in the kitchen now I forgot) Come on give me some help, hey
Head is the answer - head, is the answer
Head is the future - do it for the future girl
{Don't second guess yourself}
Come on, give me some help

[Jay Rock]
And I just wanna wanna wanna wanna
And I just wanna wanna wanna wanna - straight up {*echoes*}
Eyes with my head
And I can use some help - straight up {*echoes*}

Head is the future</pre>

Typed by: Cedmaster3K

{*instrumental plays on for 57 seconds*}

[Chorus: Anna Wise]
Somebody said you, bumped your head and, bled the floor
Jumped into a, pit of flames and, burned to coal
Drowned inside the, lake outside, away you flow...
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world toooo me
And that means the world to me

[Kendrick Lamar]
Somebody said you, bumped your head and, bled the floor
Jumped into a, pit of flames and, burned to coal
Drowned inside the, lake outside, away you flow
And this I know

I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my trunk
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular, I'm drunk
How can I can make them popular? Pop 'em when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
Fuckin' up the system, I ain't fuckin' with society
Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time, I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself at the intersection parked
Watched you when you walked inside your house, you threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creepin' through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
every piece of your brain 'til your son jumped in your arms
Cut on the engine then sped off in the rain, I'm gone

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Drove alone with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle

[Punch]
Lit off Henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel
Wait, that's a bit ambitious, maybe I'm trippin'
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes, I see the distance
It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God but still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I'm lost, the cost of bein' successful
is equal to bein' neglectful, I pray my experience helps you
As for me, I'm tryna sort it out
Searchin' for loopholes in my bruised soul but who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key so I am king

[Anna Wise]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (ahh)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (ahh, ahh, ahh)

[Kendrick Lamar]
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is Father Time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligence, my confidence just died

[Jay Rock]
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise
A tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets, they seein' me as I pacify
But couldn't fathom the meanin' of seein' sacrifice

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm passin' lives on a daily, maybe I'm losin' faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake

[Jay Rock]
I'm sleep walkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm out of place
Reinforcin' this heat barkin', these are the brakes
Before I blink, do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or this is just a mirage or a facade? Wait</pre>

Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Kendrick Lamar]
These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I seeee
A Gemini, duality personalities always conflict in meeee

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (CeeLo Green)
Oh! But don't be scared of me girl (I can explain)
I know it's foreign to you, I know it's hard to believe
God give me the favor (let me explain)
More than a compliment, and I could use some assistance
Let me show you how (I can explain)
Oh, oh shando, I spin around two times
I'll be there with the answer (let me explain)

[CeeLo Green]
I'm bizarre; avant-garde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive; you're intrigued
Am I +Mortal Man+ or make believe?
Anything you want (I can explain) I can explain it
Any misunderstandings baby (let me explain) I can explain it
Why don't you sit and talk to me awhile? (I can explain) let me explain it
Ahhhh yes (let me explain)

[Kendrick Lamar]
My momma told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no I'm not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways, praise the Lord
You teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant, I mean we
love a woman and think we can satisfy her between sheets
Covers and pillows
I'm promisin' your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
I'm promisin' that I'm acknowledgin' you as my hero cause you believe in me
No you're not easily impressed but I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws, look at my imperfections in awe
Look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And that's alright because I like it, you and me are the same
Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (CeeLo Green)
Because I know for sure who you are (I can explain)
Your momma raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand washin' your clothes on Sunday (let me explain)
Walking your brother to school
Three miles away to feed him knowledge so (I can explain)
Don't you explain that
Don't you explain the reason why your mind, it travels (let me explain)
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you but don't you EVER (let me explain)
Oh, oh shando, I spin around two times
A blessing in disguise~! (I can explain)
I know for sure who you are
You're the goddess of the odd, I am yours (I can explain)
I am yours, I am yours, I am yours
I am yoooours, yoooours, yoooours

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Ndiseza, ndingene, khaluma, vumile (yoooours, yoooours)

[Interlude]â¨
Compton is where I'm from
Is where I'm from, where is I'm from

{*Part 2*}

[Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah yeah, young Egypt
Look look

I feel like Pacino in "Godfather", I'm charged
Our Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous 'til I dealt with the consequence
The greatest and latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of makin' your choice and writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital
Avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies with batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid, just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar
on youth centers, buildings and Beamers and blue leather
Forecasted my future, this is the future
The mastermind until my next album, more power to you {*gunshot*}

{*Part 3*}

[Kendrick Lamar]
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on

[Interlude]
This is a fifteen minute song (ahahahah)
We're just jammin' out, we on stage
Taz, we just jammin' out
Hundred thousand (ah yeah, aww shit)
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it
Look look look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody

[Kendrick Lamar - singing]
Now I don't let you down down for you'll see, you'll see, you'll see, you'll see
But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you, uhh
They say the government, ain't the truth, truth, truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth

But head is the answer, head is the future
Don't second guess yourself; come on, give me some help
Hey one more time band, I need y'all to help me out right now
Head is the answer, head is the future
It's the future, that nigga said
Don't second guess yourself; come on, give me some help
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, my background singer, come on, come on
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

I said, girl you make me wanna, uhh
Break this, the hoes screamin' now
Uhh, I said baby you make
You make me wanna just.. AHH~!!
Baby you got me speechless right now
{*ad-libs in the background*} (You gotta take it there)
I gotta take it there, I ain't even playin' no more, uhh

Said you just make me wanna Drake you, down to the, ground
To the, ground like, bam bam bam bam bam, ju-
You just make me wanna Drake you, down to the, ground
Off the, ground like, bam bam bam bam bam
And baby if your momma's around, if your momma's around
If your momma's around, if your momma's around
Tell her, tell her
No discrimination (hahahah!) she young nigga chasin'
And she can get this dick too!
I said - come on, come on, come on, come on, come on (hahahahah)
Come on - yeah nigga
You gotta do it, man (oh my god)

Song:   untitled 08 | 09.06.2014.
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Kendrick Lamar]
Why so sad?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Walkin' around with them, blue faces!
She said "I'm down on my luck
And it's somethin' I gotta have"
Blue faces!
I hit the bank today and told them "Color me bad"
Blue faces!
Get that new money, and itâs breakin' me down honey

[Kendrick Lamar]
Two tears in the bucket, I cry with you
Uh, but I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light, like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience, and you're relatin'
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didnât hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut my success, Corvettes by tomorrow
(Wait a minute!) Now why you so sad?

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don't give a damn
Intuition, she got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you woman, I console you woman
You feel like the universe owes you woman
Oh the anticipation of hopin' you could make it
Bitches don't prosper, chasin' education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If ya can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasin' stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
Why you so sad?

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I wrote this song lookin' at a broke home baby (broke home baby!)
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies (broke boy and babies!)
Somebody yell "Kendrick American, they sho' is crazy"
And I said "Why?" Then he looked me in the eye

And said "Nigga you fucked up, you're bankin' on good luck
You wishin' for miracles, you never been through shit
You're cryin' hysterical, you settle for everythin'
Complain about everythin', you say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain't shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm livin' to keep warm, you livin' to pay rent
I prayed my way through, by waitin' on Allah
You played your way through, by livin' in sci-fi
Bullshittin' yourself, you talkin' to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat lookin' for hope
And all you can say is that you're lookin' for dope
These days ain't no compromise
And your pain ain't mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain't shit to me
Bitch I made my moves with shackled feet"
Cape Town

[Interlude]
In today's day and age
We practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker (why so sad?)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Pimp pimp~! (Hooray!)</pre>

[Bekon]
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You deciiide
Are we gonna liiive, or diiie?

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
So I was takin' a walk the other day
and I seen a woman, a blind woman, pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? 
"Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance? 
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it"
She replied, "Oh yes, you have lost something
You've lost... your life" {*gunshot*}

[Bekon] Is it wickedness?

[Outro]
"Lamar stated his views, uhh, Lamar stated his views
 Uhh, Lamar stated his views, uhh, Lamar stated his views
 Uhh, Lamar stated his views on police brutality
 with that line in the song, quote: 
 'And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'.'"
"Aww please, uhh, I don't like it."</pre>

Song:   DNA.
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Kendrick Lamar]
I got, I got, I got, I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua's new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate then off your fuckin' head
This that "put the kids to bed"
This that - I got, I got, I got, I got realness
I just kill shit cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA
I just win again then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire "skrrt" the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See you's a, you's a, you's a bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prol'ly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work, and absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve, and that's a riff, gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on Earth, salute the truth when the prophet say

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
{"This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage 
to young African Americans than racism in recent years"}
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
(I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life)
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA (I live a better, fuck your life)
{"5, 4, 3, 2, 1"}
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin', money and power, the makin' of marriages

[Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix, dodgin' bullets
Reapin' what you sow and stackin' up the footage
Livin' on the go and sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, "Godfather" goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder, our DNA</pre>

Song:   YAH.

[Intro: Kid Capri]
New shit, new Kung Fu Kenny!

[Kendrick Lamar]
I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close, get money, fuck bitches
I double parked the Aston in the red
My momma told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read

[Chorus 2X: Kendrick Lamar]
Buzzin'
Radars is buzzin' - yah yah
Yah yah, yah yah
Yah yah, yah yah

[Kendrick Lamar]
Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
FOX News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest muse is my niece, she worth livin'
See me on the TV and scream "That's Uncle Kendrick"
... Yeah that's the bid'ness
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'm a Israelite, don't call me black no mo'
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth
Said know my worth, and Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed

I know he walks the Earth
But it's money to get, bitches to hit, yah
Zeroes to flip, temptation is, yah
First on my list, I can't resist, yah
Everyone together now, know that we forever

[Chorus]</pre>

[Intro: Kid Capri]
New Kung Fu Kenny~!
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Y'all know what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Here we go!

[Kendrick Lamar]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a fuck

I'm willin' to die for this shit
I done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit
Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit
D.O.T. my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy
I been stomped out in front of my momma
My daddy commissary made it to commas
Bitch all my grandmas dead
So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy
Thirty millions later, know the Feds watchin'
Auntie on my telegram like "Be cautious"
I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nahhh, take me out my element

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ay, an imaginary rich nigga, ay
Seven figures hoe, that slimmer than my bitch figure, ay
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ay
Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ay
We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy cause I go yeah, I go yeah
They never been ready, yeah I know, yeah I know yeah
100K spread across the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow yeah, the flow yeah
Years in the makin' and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at their laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Damned if I do, if I don't (yuhhh)
Goddamn us all if you won't (yuhhh)
Damn damn damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't frontline, get out the goddamn way
Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need receipt, huh?
Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference between black artists and wack artists

[Chorus] - screwed

[Kid Capri - over Chorus]
It's the one and only
The world's greatest, the KIIID Capri!</pre>

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar] + (female)
Ain't nobody prayin' for me (ain't nobody prayin' for me)
Ain't nobody prayin' for me (nobody, prayin', for me)
Fo'real, ain't nobody (ain't nobody) prayin' for me 
(Ain't nobody prayin' for me - nobody, prayin', for me)

[Kendrick Lamar]
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience, I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world, the world is endin'
I'm done pretendin' and fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin', I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit I feel like

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin'

[Kendrick Lamar]
I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it, I am legend
I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic, I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual, I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like, the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope, a quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe; look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with, darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit, internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' what 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin' but nothin' is awkward
The feelin' won't prosper, the feelin' is toxic
I feel like I'm boxin' demons, monsters
False prophets schemin', sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks, and bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
FUCK your feelings, I mean this for imposters~!
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say somethin', I feel like take somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
But who the fuck prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'</pre>

Song:   LOYALTY.
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: DJ Dahi] + (Kendrick Lamar)
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get higher (higher, higher)
Girl you look so good, it's to die for (die for)
Ooh that pussy good, it's to die for (on fire)

[Chorus One: Kendrick Lamar + Rihanna]
It's a, secret society, all we ask is trust
(All we ask is trust) All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Kendrick Lamar]
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again, I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now (only for the dollar sign)

[Rihanna]
Bad gyal RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve deeper now
On your pulse like a CDM
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established, hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I'm alright

[Kendrick] + (Rihanna) + {both}
I'm a savage, I'm an asshole, I'm a king
{Shimmy-ya, shimmy-ya, shimmy-ya, rock} (yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
{Ain't no other love like the one I know}
I done been down so long I slowed
I done came down so hard I slowed
I don't sleep forever {all a real nigga want}

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar] + (DJ Dahi)
(I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up) Fired, fire
(All I want tonight is just to get higher)
All I want is, all I want is - loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Chorus Two: Kendrick Lamar + Rihanna]
10-4, no switchin' sides, feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride with me no more
I need - loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drank?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Rihanna]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (mmm)
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?
I said tell me who you loyal to

[Kendrick Lamar + Rihanna]
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?

[Kendrick] That's what God for

[Interlude] + [Chorus Two]

[Outro: Rihanna]
It's so hard to be humble, mmm
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby</pre>

I care {I care}

[Kendrick Lamar]
Hell-raisin', wheel-chasin', new worldly possessions
Flesh-makin', spirit-breakin', which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love 'em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in men
I put my faith in these lyrics hopin' I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down, last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealin' with cold thumb
I'm willin' to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can't fake humble just cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just cause your ass is insecure

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar + Anna Wise]
Maybe I wasn't theeere
Maybe I wasn't theeere
Maybe I wasn't theeere
Maybe I wasn't theeere

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

[Chorus] + [Interlude]</pre>

[Intro]
Nobody pray for me, it's been that day for me
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Ay, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits but now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D'USSE with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block then break it down, we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral~!
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know
Bitch be humble

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
(Hol' up bitch) Sit down (hol' up lil', hol' up lil' bitch) be humble
(Hol' up bitch) Sit down (sit down lil', sit down lil' bitch) be humble 
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up lil' bitch) Bitch sit down, be humble
(Hol' up bitch) Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up lil', hol' up lil' bitch) Sit down, be humble
(Hol' up bitch) Sit down (hol' up, sit down lil', sit down lil' bitch) be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up lil' bitch) Bitch sit down (hol' up bitch) be humble
(Hol' up bitch) Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) 

[Kendrick Lamar]
Who that nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fuckin' up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your momma's couch in Polo socks, ay
This shit way too crazy, ay, you do not amaze me, ay
I blew cool from AC, ay, Obama just paged me, ay
I don't fabricate it, ay, most of y'all be fakin', ay
I stay modest 'bout it, ay, she elaborate it, ay
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ay
Watch my soul speak, you, let the meds talk, ay
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ay
I'm the realest nigga after all
Bitch be humble

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water, somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's; I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much? Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that, girl I respect the cat
I promise just a tooouch, let me put the head in
If it's okay; she said "It's okay"

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfu-
("Door and his Nike Air Rattles, rush the fire exit")
("No time for battles, well I, I never expected")
This that new shit
This that new, new shit

[Kendrick Lamar]
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make you
{"Door in his Nike Air Rattles, rush the fire exit"}
{"No time for battles, well I, I never expected"}
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy - hol' up
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies, stunt on your baby mama, sip some lean
Go get a pistol, shoot out the window, bet your favorite team
Play you some Madden, go to the club or your momma house
Whatever you doin', just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make him pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in the trance, feelings are dead, what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money, call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried and our feeling's deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Lately I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately my lust been hidin' (lately!)
Lately it's all contradiction - lately I'm not here
Lately I lust over self - lust turn into fear
Lately in James 4:4 says
"Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord."
Brace yourself, lust is all yours

[Chorus]</pre>

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Damn, love or lust
Damn, all of us

("Another world premier!")

[Chorus: Zacari] + (Kendrick Lamar)
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely.. livin' lovely
Just loooove me
(I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with) Just love me, just love me, just love
(I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with) Love me
(I wanna be with you) Love me, just love me

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar] + (Zacari)
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me?)
If I minimize my net worth, would you still (love me?)
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it a whole one hund'; don't got you, I got nothin'

[Kendrick Lamar]
Ay, I got somethin', ay, hol' up
We gon' function, ay, no assumptions, ay 
Feelin' like Tyson with it, knock it out twice, I'm with it 
Only for the night, I'm kiddin' - only for life, you're a homie for life
You're a homie for life, let's get it, hit that shoulder lean
I know what comin' over mean, backstroke oversea
I know what you need, already on ten, our money come in
All feelin' go out, this feelin' don't drought, this party won't end

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar] + (Zacari)
I'm on the way, we ain't got no time to waste
Poppin' your gum on the way (love me)
Am I in the way? I don't wan' pressure you none
I want your blessin' today (love me)
Oh by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way (love me)
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me babe
Damn it, we jammin', bad attitude from yo' nanny
Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena? I took the studio camry
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made, told you that I'm on the way
I'm like an exit away, yup

Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Bekon]
America
God bless you if it's good to ya
America, please take my hand
Can you help me underst-

("New Kung Fu Kenny~!")

[Kendrick Lamar]
Throw a steak off the ark to a pool full of sharks
He'll take it...
Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis
He'll make it (he'll make it)
Take the gratitude from him, I bet he'll show you somethin'
Whoa (whoa)
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like "Bitch I did that"
X-rated...
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'...
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (no mo') ...
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him

Yesterday I got a call like from my dawg like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosphin' on what the Lord had done
He said "K-Dot, can you pray for me? It's been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome"
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed"
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a niggas' spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like "Bitch I did that!"
Ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back

Alright kids, we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me) Damn!

[Chorus: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to be a sound 
of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

[Kendrick Lamar]
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices; banks, employees and bosses with
homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin? Pass the gin
I mix it with American blood then bash him in
You Crippin' or you married to Blood? I'll ask again
Oops, accident
It's nasty when, you set us up then roll the dice then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles then tell FOX to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera

Album:  DAMN.
Song:   FEAR.
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

("I don't think I could find a way to make it on this Earth")

[Intro: Carl Duckworth]
What's up family? Yeah, this your cousin Carl man
Just givin' you a call man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo mind lately
and I know you feel like, you know, people ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this man, that we are a cursed people
Deuteronomy 28:28 says "The Lord shall smite thee with madness
and blindness and astonishment of heart."
See family, that's why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that way...

[Interlude: Charles Edward Sydney Isom Jr.]
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won't you burn this muh'fucka?
("I don't think I could find a way to make it on this Earth")

[Kendrick Lamar - backwards]
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won't you burn this muh'fucka?

[Kendrick Lamar]
I beat yo ass, keep talkin' back; I beat yo ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo ass if you walk in this house with tears in your eyes
Runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice, go back outside
I beat yo ass, lil nigga; that homework better be finished, I beat yo ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all, that TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up; I beat yo ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo ass, you know my patience runnin' thin, I got beaucoup payments to make
County buildin's on my ass tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo ass if I beat yo ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs...
I'm high now (high!) I'm high now (high!)
I'm high now (high!) I'm high now (high!)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
{"I don't think I could find a way to make it on this Earth"}

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too 'laxed 
Or die from waitin' on it, die cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs 
{"I've been hungry all my life"}
I'm high now (high!) I'm high now (high!)
I'm high now (high!) I'm high now (high!)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
Nowâ¦

[Kendrick Lamar]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated ten times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my momma stressin'
Thirty shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin', drill somethin'
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

[Interlude: Bekon]
Goddamn you, goddamn me
Goddamn us, goddamn we
Goooddamn us all

[Outro: Carl Duckworth]
Verse two says "You only, have I known, of all the families of the Earth
Therefore I will punish you, for all your iniquities"
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna feel this way
We're gonna be under this curse because He said he's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics and Native American Indians
are the true children, of Israel
We are the Israelites according to the Bible
The children of Israel, He's gonna punish us for our iniquities
for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods 
that are the last as of his son, so the Lord thy God chasten thee
So just like you chasten your own son
He's gonna chastise you because He loves you
So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments
and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us
We're gonna be at a lower state in this life 
that we live here in today in United States of America
I love you son, and I pray for you
God bless you, shalom</pre>

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
This what God feel like
Huh, he-yeah 
Laughin' to the bank like "Ahhh-ha!"
Huh, he-yeah
Flex on swole like "Ahhh-ha!"
Huh, he-yeah
You feel some type of way then, ahhh-ha!
Huh, he-yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Ever since a young man (since a young man)
All I wanted to be was a gunman (was a gunman)
Shootin' up the charts, better run, man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it JT
I'm at large, runnin' plays like a circuit JT
I'm sellin' verses JT, watch me work it JT
Look look, hol' up
Don't judge me, my, momma, caught me, with a, strap
Don't judge me, I was, young, fuckin', all the, rats
Don't judge me, aimin', at your, head, for a, stack
Don't judge...
Don't judge me, now my, home, got a, Valley, peak
Don't judge me, if I, press your, line, you a, freak
Don't judge me, won't you, tell a, friend, y'all gon', see

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck is you talkin' to? Ay, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes, God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness, or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred, get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble, nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more; for the cause I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all, everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine, everything I say is from an angel
I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit - levitate, duckin' haters
Oh my, my heart is rich, my heart is famous

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar - over Chorus]
This what God feel like {*8X*}</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Bekon, Kid Capri
Album:  DAMN.
Song:   DUCKWORTH.
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Bekon] + (Kid Capri)
It was always me vs. the world
Until I found it's me vs. me
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
(Just remember what happens on Earth stays on Earth!)
(We gon' put it in reverse!)

[Interlude: Ted Taylor sample]
"Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Oh Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mu'fucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts, children listen, it gets deep
See once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable
Gun violence, crack spot, federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier
Hard times, momma on crack, a four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodgin' policemen, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
$10,000 dollars out of a project housin', that's on the daily
Seen his first mil' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters - caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin' but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing
They say 5-0 came circlin' parkin' lots and parkin' spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it, he brushed them off
And walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken, see at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and $500 dollars
They had a son hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives, tellin' us, sellin' us, devilish, works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious, prevalent, proposition, with 9's
Ducky was well aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides; free chicken 
Every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him, in fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers you make 'em meet again
Inside recordin' studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight {*gunshot*}

{*reversed audio*}

King of the shooters, looters, boosters and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistic and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winners, district and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated (king, king, king)
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken (king, king, king)
King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse (king)
King of my enemies, may they father feed, I rejoice (king)
King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion
Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
I embrace them with collision
Kings did it, king vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick (king, king, king)
All hail the king - I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards but I live old-fashioned
The lens that I'm lookin' through won't prescribe me the right glasses
Masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
Sisters and brother in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
But still-a fuck up your organization if any beef, what do you stand for?
Are you an activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you an accident or are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?
Are you a king or you smokin' bud rocks to keep you open?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die, king don't lie
king give heart, king get by
King don't fall, kingdom come
when I come, you know why (king, king, king, king!)
I am T'Challa~!</pre>

Song:   All the Stars
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro/Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhhh)
I know the feeling haunt you (ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhhh)

[Chorus: SZA]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

[Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin new to me
You could bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize you far as confidence and calculated promises
All in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy cause I ain't invite you
Oh you important? You the moral to the story? You endorsin?
Motherfucker I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin with
A small percentage who I'm buildin with
I want the credit if I'm losin or I'm winnin
On my momma that's the realest shit

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[SZA]
Skin-covered ego
Get to talkin like you're in for it
Like a rebound
No control, no off switch
In the way that you bringin me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin
How did it all go to feel good?
You could live it all if you feel bad
Better live your life
We were runnin out of time

[Intro]
Zoom then

[Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck y'all want from me?
Y'all don't want money, y'all don't want from me
Y'all wanna die in the chase of things
We all gon' die, embrace the thing
Trapped inside a burnin' church
Made it out alive, God know my worth
Raw face, Scarface
Y'all face more defeat, I know it hurts
20 of 'em, 20 on call
Got 20 in my hand, got 20 on judge
Gave 20 to my dawg, got 20 on girls
That'll fuck you to (zoom zoom zoom)
That'll fuck you to fuck you over
Take your safe, take your keys, take your Rover
Take the heart you thought you had
Speed off, rollin' up life in a taxi cab

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (woman)
Opps on the radar (you're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (you're dead to me)
{*bleep*} takes all (you're dead to me)
(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)
You know what zone I'm in (you're dead to me)
Don't care who you with (you're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (you're dead to me)
(You're dead to me) {zoom then}

[Vince Staples]
Ay ay, ready, set, go crazy
Here to finesse, you see I'm getting mines
A life hit a nigga with a lemon's lime
Like what at night, we still committin' crimes, spittin' rhymes
Bought a coupe with the spinnin' rims, get inside
Bring a friend, bleedin' hands from the genocide
Clean me up, beam me up to the other side
Brothers die cause coons turn to butterflies
They don't wanna see me sittin' in the Benz
They don't wanna see me livin' on the end
Of the city in a citywide bend
Show no pity in the city for the sin
They don't wanna see me gettin' to the check
They just wanna see me swimmin' in the debt
Don't drown on ground, wait until you hear
9-1-1, freeze (zoom zoom) dead

[Chorus]

[Yugen Blakrok]
I move like a millipede
When I flex them tendons like rubber trees
Young Millie Jackson back to the shit
Mouthpiece drawn, got a verbal armory
Stack bodies, not figurines
Move beneath the surface, submarine
I'm half machine, obscene with a light sword
Look inside the brain, it's a ride in the psych ward
What you standin' on the side for?
Roar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg
Spit slick, attack is subliminal
Flowers on my mind but the rhyme style sinister
Stand behind my own bars like a seasoned criminal
Gotham City streets, I'll play the {*bleep*}
Crushin' any system that belittles us
Antidote to every poison they administer
Switch it like time signatures
Colors in my aura tend cover the perimeter
Brown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through
Hi-Rez lasers wanna (zoom zoom zoom)
Roll over your eyes
My strength ain't nothin' like my size
Blades on the top, Kathleen Cleaver
Tangle my chords like a weaver (zoom then)

[Chorus]</pre>

Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: sample of Travis Scott's "Drugs You Should Try It"]
"Try it if it feels, riiight (try it)"
"I try it, if it feels riiiight, yeah"
"When you tryyyy, ohhh, ohhh"

[Jorja Smith]
I'm tryin'...
I'm just, yeah, I'm just, yeah

I been out here tryna see my homecoming
And of course, somebody's always gonna say somethin'
Try and shoot me down for voicin' my own opinion
Triggerin' a part of me that's always been indifferent

[Interlude: Jorja Smith]
And I know that we have asked for change
Don't be scared to put the fears to shame

[Chorus 2X: Jorja Smith]
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free

[Jorja Smith]
Open up this letter you ain't tryin' to read
You've been blind to the subject but not blind to me
And I know that this margin ain't too small for me
Not too real, not too much anymore, not enough

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Jorja Smith + Kendrick Lamar]
If who I am, offends you, don't feel sorry
Don't feel, don't feel sorry
Don't feel, don't feel sorry

[Kendrick Lamar]
My loss is, worth more than your wins
I'm satisfied if it starts to look in

[Jorja Smith + Kendrick Lamar]
That is everything, that is everything
That is everything, that is everything
... That is everything

[Outro 2X: Kendrick Lamar]
I, try to, make it, stop, I, pray, it will, stop
I, try to, make it, stop, I, pray, it will, stop
I.. stop, I, am, what you, not
I, try to, make it, stop, I, pray, it will, stop</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar, SOB x RBE, Zacari
Album:  Black Panther: The Album
Song:   Paramedic!
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Zacari] + (Kendrick Lamar)
(I am Killmonger) No one's perfect
But no one's worthless
We ain't deservinâ of everything Heaven and Earth is
But word is, good (this is my home)
Said no one's perfect
But no oneâs worth this
We ain't deservinâ of everything Heaven and Earth is
But word is, good (Northern California)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Ayy, they better call a paramedic in the street
I got leverage in the street
I'm a California nigga and I'm heavy in the streets

[Slimmy B] + (Kendrick Lamar)
.22 or .23, I'm heavy with the heat
Hit you with this chop, paramedics can't save you (can't save you)
Really in field, c'mon boy, know that ain't you (no, it ain't you)
2018, hell nah I ain't gon fade you
Gon' paint you, TDE and SOB, we can't lose
Niggas bitch made, that's just something I can't relate to (can't relate to)
Turn on the gang, that's just somethinâ that I can't do (no, I can't do)
Fall out over a bitch, thatâs just somethinâ that I can't do (no, I can't do)
Rip every beat I get on, I was made to (I was made to)
Glock get to growlinâ, somethinâ like a +Black Panther+
Tryna touch a milâ, fuck sayin' "Get yo bands up"
Fuckinâ with the gang, yeah I had to man up
One fist in the air, I ain't finna put my hands up
Gang!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a bitch would
I wish a bitch would, I wish a bitch would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would

[Lul G] + (Kendrick Lamar)
Got shooters tappin' in, nigga for them bands nigga
West Coast niggas, yeah they blowin' fast nigga
I know I'm the man, baby bring your friends with you
Puttin' points up while you in the stands nigga
But I been stuck in these streets, you in the background (ayy)
Ever since they took my brother, gotta pack rounds
Sorry momma, two bales, took a bad route
I done got my bands up, a nigga stacked now
But we been still O.T. on that bullshit (on that bullshit)
I don't wanna have to do it, empty full clips (empty full clips)
Why these niggas talkin' robbin'? They don't do shit
High Cali niggas tapped in, we'll cook shit
Bust down on my neck, niggas reach, gettin' stretched
Rockin' with this TEC, niggas better wear a vest
Last year I was broke, young nigga in the Crest
Now a show 20 better, broke niggas keep the rest

[Chorus]

[DaBoii] + (Kendrick Lamar)
(DaBoii) California nigga and I'm heavy in these streets
If you don't keep a pole, how you ready when there's beef? (if you don't keep a pole!)
Lil nigga think he cut, yeah I bet the nigga freeze
If that nigga want me dead, I can't let that nigga breath
Want me gone? Send a shot like the real kind
These niggas actin' like they tough when they real kind
Thumbin' through a hunnid racks just to kill time
They got a nigga at the edge but I feel fine
But it come with this shit, I'm okay with it
If your man's tour last year, yeah I play with âem
One whole wood to the next, it's an eighth in it
New baby chop, let it sing, it's a Drake nigga
A lot of shit on my mind make me think a lot
Why it's hard for me to smile? Cause I seen a lot
You ain't really in the field, you just tweet a lot
If we ain't on the same page, you can kick rocks bitch~!
(And I been really tryna keep the peace)

[Yhung T.O.]
But I'm a North Vallejo nigga and I'm heavy in the streets
I was raised by my grannie and the gangsters
So at 8, I made the choice I'ma forever be a G and
I don't really like to talk
I remember we was broke and I don't really like to walk nigga
Now I ride around in foreign cars
And I put on for my team who was with me from the start nigga
I don't play games, stitch lip, I don't say names
She want a dog, I'm a Great Dane
I got great aim, Ice Age on my damn chain
My momma told me keep a stash for the damn rain
They ain't wanna see me win cause I'm black
So I pulled up in that all black Benz in the back
If you need someone to call, I'm the man for the task
You ain't standin' for the cause, meet the man in the mask</pre>

Artist: (Kendrick Lamar f/) Ab-Soul, Anderson .Paak, James Blake
Album:  Black Panther: The Album
Song:   Bloody Waters
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Meet the man in the mask
Meet the man in the mask

[James Blake]
All those days and, all that stays and
I don't keep it, I won't be here for it
All those days and, all that stays and
I don't keep it though, I won't be here for it

[Anderson .Paak]
Yes Lord, huh

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Hail Mary's in the sky (Hail Mary's in the sky)
False prophets get buried alive (alive)
Head on the throne cause that's where I reside (reside)
Ways of the world the weak won't survive
Somethin's in the water (the water) ayy, my nigga we lawless (lawless)
Please move with caution
Who set the fairway? (fairway) damn right I need all this (all this)
Yeah Jack, I need all this, ayy

[Ab-Soul]
Hitters acquitted with fingerprints on the Glock
Screamin' +We Gon' Make It+ like two-thirds of The LOX
(Yah yah, yah yah)
Blah blah becomes blah blah

Blood on my hands, I'ma need hot agua
You gon' meet âyour makerâ/Jamaica, I'm won't say it in patois
Hope I strike a nerve like a package of matches
You might wanna bypass, this smoke ain't âgas trickâ/gastric
A prince-turned-pope tryin' to do like kings do
Sweatin' in chess games, tryna move like kings move
You should slow your roll before you drown in the moat
He tried to channel balance but never found the remote
Killers on the prowl still juggin' off a lick
Still a .. with a double for his {*bleep*}
Common politics, everlastin' mayhem
Draw to stick you for' your figures, that's how they +hang man+
So what's your game plan if you got one?
You aimin' at passengers with a shotgun? (whoa)
The +Aftermath+ is you âin the scopeâ/Interscope
It's warfare, is war fair? No
You understand? It's probably better you don't
Just keep a dock on standby, charter a boat
Ship set sail and, planes depart
The big picture's in motion, are you playin' your part?
Yeah, before the lights get dark and the curtains get closed
Are you playin' your role?
As told by an organized criminal
And general, get off my genitals, I got your general

[Chorus]

[Ab-Soul]
I had to be about 9 when I first had seen it
Low lows pulled up outside of the Ralph's
After a car show at Dominguez
They had a disagreement they had to air out
Just another day in Del Amo
Fo'sho, man down, mando
Thank-thank God I never had to knock your partner off
Or be another casualty of war - amen
There's four footprints in the sand where I walk
I never claimed to be a saint at all
Weâre rushinâ/Russian, trippin' with hollow tips
And a, Kalashnikov aimed at y'all (kla ka ka-la!)
No, Soulo Hoe kept it clean
Ridin' dirty, jury would have gave me thirty
Herbie love buggin' out, hit the target blindfolded
Electorial college devoted
To hit the score, to write the score that's not a metaphor
Ragin' against the machinery, tapin' up the scenery
You gotta keep the piece to keep the peace
Got dough, squad up and mopped the block up for a cleanin' fee

[Outro: James Blake]
I don't need you to change
I don't need you to change yourself (get-get away)
But I've got to get away (get away, get-get away)
I've got to get away (get away, get-get away)
From it all (get away, get-get away)
(Get away, get-get away)
Be as free as you can (get away, get-get away)
Be as free as you can (get away, get-get away)
Away from me (get away, get-get away)
I tried to be a saint like everybody else</pre>

Artist: Jay Rock f/ Kendrick Lamar, SZA
Album:  Redemption
Song:   Redemption
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Jay Rock]
If you had a second chance in life, what would you do?
Would you put the pills down, throw out the lean too?
Treat your baby mama right and make way for your kids?
Peace with your enemies, keep the water under the bridge?
I think 'bout if my motorcycle crash was fatal
Broken bones, internal bleedin', stretched on the table
Goin' through surgery, two machines helpin' me breathe
Sorry momma, I wanna stay but I gotta leave
I see my funeral packed, I see some lyin', some cryin' and some givin' dap
I see false claimers, strangers and foes with they head in they laps
I see mo' division
I see some of them showin' up just to post a picture like they was my nigga
Instagram's a dead man's best friend
Everybody lookin' for likes but wasn't likin' you when
You needed somethin' to hold on, dealin' with life stress
Glad them angels came in surgery, said I'm not done yet

[Chorus: SZA] + (Kendrick Lamar)
I know saints, I know sinners, I know bosses
I know pain, I know wins, I know losses
My loyalty is sensitive so please don't cross me
(My loyalty is sensitive so please don't cross me)
I came to redeem myself
All I need is God's help
It's a millions of miracles
Show me the real you, the real truth

[Jay Rock]
If I had a second chance in life, this what I'd do
I buy you flowers, talk to you for hours, give you truth
I listen to you when you hurt, I shoulda went to church with you
But my credentials didn't work, I still shoulda worked with you
I shoulda left them lil' hoes alone and came home
But I blamed the moments on you, though I was in the wrong
You checked my phone and I checked you 'bout it
We never talked it over, instead we just sexted about it
I said "I'm comin' over", you turnt up and flexed about it, I hit yo momma phone
She said "Y'all get it together", she don't know what we on
My response was whatever, I'm ego trippin' however
I hate to see you gone, she gave me that dial tone
... I shoulda gave you more trust
More love, no lies, more us
Cause when my motorcycle crashed and everyone left
You was that angel at surgery sayin' I ain't done yet
Real shit

[Chorus]</pre>

Song:   Seasons
Typed by: Cedmaster3K, Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro]
Seasons chaaaaaaaaange
There's still time for us to run away
Seasons chaaaaaaaaange
There's still time for us to run away
Season

[Sjava]
San'bonan endlini
USjava kaJama Indlalifa igama ley'nsizwa
Mina, ng'phuma le enzansi, kwafel ubala
Insizwa uma ina-thirty-five, kthiwa is' indala
Laph' eng'phuma khona maw'phuma khona bathi aw'fiki la
Ngyamangala, uma ngi-la
Bebathi ng'yophelel emoyeni
Beba right, manje ngiy'nkanyezi
Njengoba ngik'tshela ngempilo yami
Ng'funa uthathe nayi imfundiso yami (lalela la wena)
Ithemba alibulali
Ukube l'yabulala ngabe nihamba phez'kwami

[Chorus: Sjava]
Poverty, jealousy, negativity
Ngith' ak'nandawo la
Go away (far away)
Poverty, jealousy, negativity
Ngith' ak'nandawo la
Go away (far away)

[Mozzy]
I cried when lil' bruh died, got high and watched the sunrise
Wiggle on 'em if it's one time, they done hung all of my people
I love all of my people, I'm in the slums with all of my people
They tried to tell us that we all equal, we get no justice so it ain't peaceful, yeah
They can bluff you, they can beat you, paid attorney, we gon' need it
Momma told me there was demons, and she ain't never lied on her Jesus
She worked her ass off just to feed us, she went to Ross to cop the new Adidas
She used to tap in with all the teachers, they wasn't teachin' nothin', it's no secret
Whole lotta crime, lil' niggas beefin', we gotta keep it or end up a victim
Trapped in the system, traffickin' drugs; modern-day slavery, African thugs
We go to war for this African blood, we go to war for this African blood
When I put niggas on, it was all out of love, you was disloyal, can't call it no love

[Chorus] - 1/2

[Reason]
(Season change) You know we off the stove with it
We stove whippin', niggas know we gon' get it
(Season change) Dodgin' cops
Fuck around and get locked, you ain't never comin' home with it
Look my nigga, I came from the sewer
Don't shit on my past, you ain't come from manure
You see Reason and you see L.A.
But bitch I ain't come for no Bruin
Just know all my niggas, we struggled for it
Had to hustle for it, cried puddles for it
My pops watched his sister get locked for it
I done seen my niggas get knocked for it
Like {*gunshot*} gimme that
I carry Del Amo like a piggyback
I carry my city like guilt that ain't got no forgiveness
No way out, shit we locked in the system
Catch a case and they not gon' forgive ya
White skin, you be out before Christmas
Shit, auntie missed eight of those days
Tears from me, had to pray those days
Had to slave those days
Shit, we had to hit up a couple hood giveaways those days
Thank God for every inch that he gave us
Thank God for everything cause he made us
Like when that car bent the block, blot blot
Hit the homie but we made to ER and he saved us
Thinkin' that he could've died nigga
We was prayin' to the sky and his momma cried rivers
Healed up but tough luck, he tried to get revenge
Had to drop, bullets popped and they killed him
Worst part is that it sound so familiar

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I am T'Challa, I am Killmonger
One world, one God, one family
Celebration</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar, The Weeknd
Album:  Black Panther: The Album
Song:   Pray For Me
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com, Cedmaster3K

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[The Weeknd]
I'm always ready for a war again
Go down that road again, it's all the same
I'm always ready to take a life again
You know I'll ride again, it's all the same (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself?
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell?
Without you, I'm all alone

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me? Take my pain from me?
Save my soul for me? Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you, if I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey

[Kendrick Lamar]
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body drop, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at Ground Zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin men, clutchin on deaf ears again
Rapture is comin, it's all prophecy
And if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good then that's what it gotta be

[Chorus]

[The Weeknd]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

[Chorus]

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar + The Weeknd]
Just in case my faith go, I live by my own law
I live by my own law, I live by my own
Just in case my faith go, I live by my own law
I live by my own law, I live by my own</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Beyonce (S)
Song:   Beyonce
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
Man, Beyonce, I'm mad at you, man

[Chorus 1]
They say hello (hey), hello (hey)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinking bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know, they say hello (hey), hello (hey)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
till I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so

[Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you were sixteen on the TV screen with Wyclef
Were you my type? Oh God yes, I was impressed
You was like 'No, no, no', I was like twelve years old
Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you're on the road
You wore braids with a banging body
Looked like you did Pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably
But bump that, I was there from the start
Even when LeToya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
Hope you didn't cry, cause honestly they were just so-so
They couldn't sing anyway, you deserved to go solo
No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle, I'm just saying
They cool, but you? You something like Wonder Woman
And I just want to hold your hand, bring you to Compton
Gonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand
Eating Hot Cheetos with pickle juice in it
Put that napkin down, you know I'll lick your fingers when you're finished

[Chorus 1]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD
I gazed at the cover for a whole five minutes till my girlfriend hit me
She's jealous of you B cause I don't love her like I love you
I even make her do the "uh-oh, uh-oh, oh-no-no" just like you do
She tell me I'm obsessed, I tell her we connect
like Ice Cube way before the Mack 10 feud
She like, you goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke
I said, so, I'm five-hundred mill' away, there's still hope
Anyway, I had feelings way before you got paid
And I didn't laugh when you bust your ass on the stage
And I salute Kanye for taking up for you
I would have stole the award just to prove that I love you
But Jay shoulda did that, I thought he had your bizzack
What happened Mr. Izzo? Hopico with Frederico?
He used to be my favorite till he abandoned my diva
Now I tell everybody Nas had killed him on 'Ether'

[Chorus 2]
They say hello (hey), hello (hey)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinking bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know, they say hello (hey), hello (hey)
Hopefully I still have a chance
Maybe if I sabotage your man
You never know, hmm

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'ma sneak backstage at a Mary J. Blige concert
with an 'I Love Mary' shirt, then find Jay-Z
and push him into a dancer, hopefully they lock lips
That's when I yell out, Sounwave, hurry up, take the pic
Put it on Bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right
Publicity like that? Yep, they'd be sure to fight
Better yet I'ma steal his cell, then call up Affion
He impersonates Jay well, get Beyonce on the line
Then make up some bogus shit
Like you don't the back of my knees right, so this marriage is over with
And the ring that's on my finger, guess what, I'm throwing it (cling)
You heard the sound, so you know I did
Ha-hahhh, that should get him
I should break 'em up like a Kit Kat when I do that, yeah true that
I'ma put the plot in motion, that's for sure
But if I end up with Macy Gray, this plan never worked

Yeeeea, man I hope Jay don't be mad at me bout this song
Start-, ay Wizzle start me back from like the first verse
Like right before I come in
Haha, what you say? Nah, you think it'll be hot for real though?
Nigga, you stupid, they probably laughing as hard as you
Nig' got the best wife in the world and shit
Run that back though?</pre>

(Miss me with that bullshit - bullshit)
You're not a gang member, you's a tourist (a tourist)

Bought an '83 Cutlass for the weekend (for the weekend)
I got a hundred thousand then I freaked it (then I freaked it)
I made 500 thousand then I freaked it (then I freaked it)
I put a Rolls Royce on my wrist, oh yeah
Fuck his baby mama, tryna sneak diss (ahh~!)
I took her to my penthouse then I freaked it (then I freaked it)
I haven't made my mind up, should I keep it? (should I keep it?)
I got big dog status, it ain't no secret
La di da di da; slob on me knob
Pass me some syrup, fuck me in the car
La di da di da, mothafuck the law
Chitty chitty bang, murder everything
{Bitch I'm on a roll and I put that on the gang} (yeah)

[Chorus]

{*beat changes*}

[Interlude: James Blake]
Changes
Is you gon' do something about it?
What you want?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Red light, green light, red light, green light, red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria, but I don't see it
I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic, tapped in when I'm maxed in
Comp-Town with the MAC 10s
and the pumps in the background, I was absent
Never OG, standout, I was lackin'
everything else but doubt in the Magnum
Holdin' Magnums with a Magnum, nigga ad-lib
and I sing out loud, never had friends
Never had ends, never had hope, they was like âNopeâ
I was like "Boo yaow, boo yaow"
(Yeah God) Tee off today
Know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be off ya head
Well late, on C4 I'm way off the edge
Fuck integrity, fuck your pedigree, fuck your feeling
Fuck your culture, fuck your moral
Fuck your family, fuck your drive
Fuck your land, fuck your children, fuck your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future, not your comfort
Not your reverence, not your glory, not your heaven
Not your angel, not your spirit, not your message
Not your freedom, not your people
Not your neighbor, not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under - all hail King Killmonger~!
Red light, green light, red light, green light
red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars...

Artist: Kendrick Lamar 
Album:  Black Friday (S)
Song:   Black Friday *
Typed by: Cedmaster3K 

* set to "A Tale of 2 Citiez" instrumental by J. Cole

[Kendrick Lamar]
Dick hard like Rottweiler, can you handle it? 
Can you handle it? Woo woo woo woo woo woo!

The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I'm just changin' the channel 
Kendrick Lamar, the people's champion, I'm animal for analysts 
Career damagin' verses, meditatin' with candles lit 
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestylin' on lunch tables and park benches 
And I won't mention my ten thousand hours in training
While jugglin' gang-bangin', my balancin' was tremendous 
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin' out before we even get a chance to miss 'em 
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it's both and I got large amounts of it, it's real 
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y'all incapable
to be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself 
I'm +Rolling Deep+ in that paper like two Adeles 
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips 
We had to shake the game up and you're flyin' through turbulence 
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that's how it played nowadays
It's like an 8-ball to the face nowadays, I'm laced nowadays
My gun is off the waist nowadays 
It's seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays
I'm talkin' higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breakin' the padlock 
And the dead coward dyin' a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah! 
This is what they want, I'm the one
This is vintage from nineteen eighty-somethin'
I'm the son of the pioneer that got you niggas on 
Play with him, bitch you better off votin' for Donald Trump
I'm yellin' Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I'm in the White House goin' all out
Bumpin' "College Dropout", God-bless Americans 
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I'm David Blaine-in' all you hoes 
Oh yeah, let's go there, my DNA is DMT, I'm so rare 
My +Juvenile+ was wilder than the Nolia 
A locomotive couldn't track me down in my career 
Runnin' this shit with four pair, son of my bitch
I might demolish a bitch right in front ya
Chico what have you done here? 
Deebo all of it one year, Mississippi to California 
It gets annoyin', niggas wanna deploy him
And bitches wanna adore him but industry shit ain't for him
Probably thinkin' it's for him, only one me 
Swallowed the key and kickin' the door in, never leasin' my foreign 
Mr. Valedictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them 
I'm snappin' off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin'
My radiance rather gorgeous, $100 bill to the doorman
Hundred mil' in my fortune, they call me back in the morning 
You're racin' against the tortoise, pace myself, it's important 
Lace myself with the wisdom, my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments 
Jimi Kendrix performin', this fucking studio haunted (ahhhh!) 
I tell a bitch don't sweat me (don't sweat me)
I kill this whole fuckin' beat if Cole let me (please Cole)
Ib should've never sent the instrumental 
Every time I start writin', I get sentimental
{*sniff*} This shit is just not fair
{*sniff*} But why the fuck should I care? 
{*sniff*} The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y'all gon' die here 
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams 
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But #9 makes sure he lives on, yeah 
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance 
Every day a celebration
But even the valley peakin' me is not validation
Nigga this TDE and my doggies be salivatin'
Salaries, better ratings and casualties all around me
don't make me do demonstrations
Whoa! ...
Murder my allegations and burnin' my finger traces
Adjournin' my power patience and earnin' royalty payments 
I'm sorry, y'all not relatin', this party is reservated 
I kill this whole mothafuckin' beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it 
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I'm not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin' greatest
Whoa! ... 
Burnin' my leather d- (nah I'm just fuckin' wit'cha...) </pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Gunplay (Triple C's)
Album:  Cartoon & Cereal (S)
Song:   Cartoon & Cereal
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Intro: channel surfing samples]
"I want to hit line drives"
"Want to lose weight? Well keep eating..."
"For you"
"In my financial situation"
"Heeey, what's up Doc?"

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Now I was raised in a sandbox next to you and her
You was holding a handgun, she was giving birth
to a baby boy, to be just like you, I, I wonder what that's worth
I, I wonder if you, you ever knew you was a role model to me first
The next day I, I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I, I, I had something to prove
You told me "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar] + (Gunplay)
And I run it "blow-blow-blow-blow!", and I run it "blow-blow-blow-blow!"
And I run it "yeah! blow!", and I run it "yeah! blow!"
That's ironic "blow-blow-blow-blow!", I run it "blow-blow-blow-blow!"
That's ironic "yeah-yeah! blow!", I run it "yeah! blow! yeah!"
(Salt all in my wounds
 Hear my tears all in my tunes
 Let my life loose in this booth
 just for you muh'fucker, hope y'all amused)
And I run it "blow-blow-blow-blow!", and I run it "blow-blow-blow-blow!"
And I run it "yeah-yeah! blow!", and I run it "yeah! blow!"
That's ironic

[Interlude: channel surfing samples]
"In my financial situation"
"With the liberation, his leader..."
"Popular pie plant pictured here"
"Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote!"

[Kendrick Lamar] - (Kendrick chants in the background "Elmer Fudd said, 'Shoot him down'")
This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I'm maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never glory twenty-five
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
That's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun
How come your tongue say killer, then kill my mood?
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
till I wreck into a pole/poll like a right to vote
I am from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra lookalike
Hope another homicide don't numb you, and none do
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon, that's an error
You can smell it in the air, and everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you muh'fuckers, all y'all can suck my dick
All them days at the county building, now I'm bout to make my momma rich
Cartoons and (cereal), I ain't felt this (good since)
Scrooge McDuck, (here we go), elementary hood shit

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Kendrick Lamar] - (Kendrick chants in the background "Elmer Fudd said, 'Shoot him down'")
This shit make a nigga just wanna shit
on everybody, even with a pot to piss in
I'ma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
that ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounced
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head, he deserved it
Overheard it in my bed with a bowl and remote control
Darkwing Duck lost service
Momma said I better duck, she's nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean, don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the Feds stay lurking
Emerging on everybody corner, (dash for it)
Get a toe tag when you play tag with the task of a new (task force)
Everybody wanna know my life, how did I make it (past yours)?
Well let me tell you like this, I've been running this shit since I (asked for) 
cartoons and cereal

[Chorus 1]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And I run it

[Gunplay]
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
just for you muh'fucker, hope y'all amused
I did wrong, karma came
Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends, enemies, all the same
State, Fed, both can hang
Nobody can mute me
But I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely
Every day feel like the one before
Hunt the money, don't hunt the hoe
If you do what you always done
then you get what you always got, you dumb buffoons
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
for bout the past seventy-two hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I'll pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah this me, no mic
No cameras, no lights
Just pain
Momma, how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain!

Artist: Kendrick Lamar, Mike WiLL Made-It, Pharrell Williams
Album:  Creed II: The Album
Song:   The Mantra
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
In the way
Minus sign niggas in the way
In the way
Minus sign niggas in the way, yeah
In the way
Minus sign niggas in the way, yeah
In the way, yeah
Minus sign niggas in the way
But they will not get none, nah - in the way {"EarDrummers"}
Minus sign niggas in the way
Yeah, they will not get nothin', nah - in the way (in the way! Yeah)
Minus sign niggas in the way (repeat after me, hey)
{"Mike WiLL Made-It"}

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
They will not get none, nah (in the way)
It's funny to watch them 'em there attempt that blockin'
But they will not get none, nah (in the way - hey!)
He's watchin' me (minus sign niggas in the way)
They will not get none, nah (in the way)
The stars will keep fallin', like asteroids we ballin'
So they will not get none, nah (in the way)
Watchin' me (minus sign niggas in the way, hey!)

[Pharrell Williams]
If it ain't a half a million in the face (in the face)
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way (in the way)
If it ain't a half a million when you race (when you race)
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way (it's in the waaaaaay)
If you good with good, not great
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way
No remote on the G5 plane
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way (it's in the waaaaaay)
You can't fall back to sleep once you awake
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way
You ain't supposed to worry about it when you pray
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way (it's in the waaaaaay)
If what you doin' don't help you elevate
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way
If you don't share the culture, shouldn't play (when you play)
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way (hey!)

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I was down bad, then my life switched (then my life switched)
What a crisis, my Black Seville with no license (no license)
I was lifeless, I was deadweight, I was triflin' (I was triflin')
Then my eye twitched, then my hand shook, and my fist balled, then my right wrist
took a risk for us, saw lightning that made titans (I was triflin')
With a pitchfork, we ate yo' food then got bent more with excitement
Big wars on my neck piece, VVS be fightin'
Move fast like loose jazz, I gotta race the world and be vibrant
No plates on my scrape, yeah that's mando'
Massagin' the handle, left hand on the candle (huh)
I'm too high profile to drive Lambo
That there is a scandal, that man grab a handful (huh)
Never been loved (easy) bet I pull up (beep beep)
I got a thing for her, I wanna fuck (freaky)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (easy)
I got a thing for her
I mean I get you niggas out the way right now today, you say so
Take the safe and doctor pay 'em, aimin' 'fore the case closed
Operate then meet the play, I move on then for escrow
Holdin' weight since Section 8 that's on my day to day though
Man-Man don't shake hand, he pop shit (out the way)
She stargaze out through the cosmic (out the way)
Amped up, we blew out the metropolis (out the way)
And I've been too involved, huh (out the way) and I got tens on call, huh (out the way)
And you pretend you ball, huh, I'ma do this for my dawg, you need a life jacket
Throw you in the deep end, that's now my target practice
Never been loved (easy)
Bet I pull up (beep beep) I got a thing for her

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
They will not get none, nah (in the way)
Yeah all that they talkin', that is blessing blockin'
So they will not get none, nah (in the way)
He's watchin' me (minus sign niggas in the way)
They will not get none, nah (in the way)
That bulletproof aura, knowin' God is for you
So they will get nothin' off you, yeah (in the way - yeah)
Watchin' me (minus sign niggas in the way)</pre>

[Tame Impala]
It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says "go ahead".
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards darling.

[Verse 1]
And we'll be screaming out "No Rules, No Rules"
Feel the energy we go through, I told you
Pump my fist like I'm supposed to, I showed you
My vision of the unsocial, is so cool
Look around me and just see the same, who to blame?
See my generation has no shame, I play the game
How I see it this is inside the future, this is nothing that you're used to
I refuse to play the victim my religion is to move you
Out your power position my army head on collision
Cant harm me out of my own skin, government need assistance
Every time that I zone in
Nothing is more convincing than telling you that I won't bend
Break or fake partition
I can't, this is my life design
This is me taking mines, this is what I live for
This is me taking yours, this is more than c4
This is what happens when we're ready to build and destroy
I hope that you enjoy

[Tame Impala]
It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says "go ahead".
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards darling.

[Verse 2]
I live my life a rebel, a vigilante, Devils try to get at me
Pedal through this underworld undertakers won't catch me
System make no sense don't feel justice if you would ask me
I'll tell you everything is corrupted don't you walk passed me
With the condescending look I can tell you're pretending
Like you my friends and you just a henchman I feel relentless
I feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
Or cut you with it I come from a glove that breed a nuisance
Trespass on your property I am properly aiming to go and get your democracy
This is me changing faces cuz I can stand alone and die alone as long as I got pride
The victory and fight is all in my eyes
The night is young and I can see your demise
I'm waiting for it
You can't ignore it you live dormant
I die enormous
Big as the lies you tell I can tell that you feel defeated
The truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason
Capisce

[Tame Impala]
It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says "go ahead".
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards darling.</pre>

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Abba Zabba
You know we get in the studio and do what we do best, you know?
Beautiful shit
But this time around I want to do something different homeboy
You feel me my nig'?
Hop on them keys real quick my nig'

[Chorus]
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like
Yeah, ha-ha-ha, yeah
This shit my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend will like

[Kendrick Lamar]
Check me out, she say she love it when it sounds like this
She tell me Kendrick, put it down like this
When I listen I want to close my eyes and feel your lips
Let your lyrics wrap/rap around me and grab my hips
So enticing, on point like the helmet of a viking
Kicking up dust like I'm hiking
I ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one
I be calling my woman so I can get some
She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard
She take off her shirt and Lord knows that I'm hard
Composing myself, tryna remain content
She had a long day and plus I know she want to vent
Now she can talk about her boss and I can give advice
or she can take the panties off and I can eat the pie
Fuck that, option number deuce
On the kitchen table while I play this tune, you know why?

[Chorus]
This shit that my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend will like
Ha-ha-ha, yeah
This shit my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Abba, this shit my girlfriend will like my nigga

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look, we be in the car bumping my latest jam
I recorded at the studio around 10 P.M.
It's a club banger, catchy hooks and 808s
I even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe
The first eight bars she loving the track
Even rewinding it back soon as the beat drop
The way she react, she like that's hot
till I start talking how many hoes I got
How many I've fucked, how many I've misled
just to get a nut like a squirrel in pursuit of lunch, uh
Though I'm on some cliche rapper shit
I know she thinking all my lyrics, they're accurate
She so cool though
Don't downplay it just to fuck up the mood yo
She will still play it even though I sound rude yo
and disregards to them provocative records, one thing that I do know

[Chorus 3: Kendrick Lamar] + (Ab-Soul)
This something that my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I'm playing something that my girlfriend will like
Ne-ma-ne-ma-ne-ma-nem {*laughter*}
Told you that my girlfriend would like...
... other hoes tonight
'Soul! (This shit my girlfriend will like too, haha)
(Kendrick, I got you)

[Ab-Soul]
This a great idea
This will be girlfriend joint right here
So I'ma kick the shit she like, it seem right
like a pair of jeans that fit tight around her cute booty
I like to hold her from behind in line
at the movies, her body-language gets read
like a ruby, cause she a work of art
No help from Julie, I'm a beast and she's such a beauty
I love her, she know that, I place no one above her
Far from a narc but best under cover
Kodak moment every time we in sync
like an iPod plugged to a USB
It's just you and me, I mean me and her
I mean her and I, it's plain to see, affirmative
So if you ever need me, you know where Herbert is
On her mind like she on mine, uh
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like
cause I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
She do music too, this shit my girlfriend would write
if she was me talking bout her, DJ...

[Kendrick Lamar]
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I wrote some shit that my girlfriend would like
Now I'm sure to get some cutty</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we...

Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, I'm tryna get blown
I'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac brown, looking for E.T. to phone home
Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days
Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains
Pro Club t-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons
Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
That's fashion if you come where I'm from
Compton California, one love to the murder capital under the sun
Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
But I don't trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip
Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack
He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
And so I scooped him round 3:30
Telling me it's all good, Tiger Woods, now we looking for the +birdy+ birdies
Stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers
Pulled up on the breezies, well what do you know? I think they love us

[Chorus]
And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on
And if you feel good (hey)
raise your hands high and throw up your hood (hey)
Represent the city like you know you should (hey)
I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on

[Kendrick Lamar]
As I continue my day, quite copacetic
Headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as hell
Had the right grub, I bail, need some gas
ARCO station on Avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past
We used to stand in line for Jordans, excited we got 'em
Rocking platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
Throwback jerseys, Chamberlain and James Worthy was two of my favorites
I might pull out the green Larry Bird on special occasions
But anyway I'm steady coasting, smoking on that Hiroshima
Ashtray got a million roaches, I'm focussed but feeling good
The homies hanging on {?} and Monte Carlos
Impalas and {?}, shoot something nigga, break that fifty
I'm grabbing the city like I'm supposed to
Making my presence/presents felt like Christmas day, what can I say?
Every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a G
If you can't relate then please have a seat

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
So, wherever you located, won't you let it be known
and put on for the soil of which you was grown
I put on like brand new Chuck Taylors while giving you cuts
like fresh tapers, I'm such a fool with it, go nuts
You bullshitting like Tuck, the bounce then untuck
The bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck
Take 'em to school I must, this for the cool in us
This ain't for you, so what?!

[Chorus]</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, a lil' Compton nigga
Just a lil' Compton nigga, one time
for my niggas
You know Compton, nigga
Just a lil' Compton nigga, uh, uh
Kendrick Lamar, uh
Yo, uh

Back with a vengeance
Back with my heart and I'm venting
Back with another war pendant, salute me or shoot me
I never wore a kufi, ignored my religion
I believe there's one God, there's one love
and I believe if I fly, we all doves
I make a way for my people to see the light
Brighter than yellow bones, me and my microphone could be one
until I see BIG, 'Pac, see Pun, but this ain't +Eazy+
I can't take a +Big L+, my city needs me
I gotta win, the proof is in the pudding
and I've been fucking with Cosby since I was ten, you damn right
Any means necessary, get the campaign right
Very emotional, I'm a Gemini
I love hard and I fight harder, a born author
A born starter, in the game for real
And the games appeal to the struggling youth with no father
You can't learn if mistakes ain't made
You gotta pay homage in order to get paid
You gotta pay attention in order to pay dues
and you ain't getting it till you start paying jewels
Lifestyles of the young and the broke
With my hand under oath, I recite these quotes
And if I ever lied then I'd die where I stand
as a pest, not a man, with a roach and a rat
In order to see the front, had to play the back
We played our position, we let y'all play yourself
Y'all made your decision, we pray while we prey on competition
to flip another page of Corinthians
I see stars when I write these sentences
Words crash cars when I write these sentences
Open jail bars for my niggas' life sentences
Free J-Dub, kill all witnesses
Y'all better hope 2012 really real
cause the way I feel, I'ma make y'all suffer
and take y'all supper
I haven't ate in the last twenty-two summers and I'm twenty-two now
It's about to go down, so en garde, my God
We got these artists in awe
Oh, I'm free
Finally, I can say I'm me
The Kendrick Lamar EP a classic EP
The question concerned
I dropped it and gave the whole world my germs
Hope y'all infected, hope y'all didn't have no protection
Still I'm progressing, room for improvement
Make room for the groom married to his music
I was at the XXL just trying to excel
Networking, meanwhile my stomach turning
Wanted to be a part of it, catering to my audience
J. Cole running late, if he don't show up
think I can take his place? Ladies start laughing
No pun intended, I ain't being sarcastic
Homie popped up with about twenty bags and
fresh off the plane, I couldn't even complain
My nigga was on his hustle, I introduced him my name
Said I'll see him on the bubble in the future
My dude I salute ya, contributing to real shit
Talk about it, make the people talk about it, make the world see
For every emcee that I see tryna steal flow
Tell 'em build a boat like Noah
and take 'em to a place that I'm sure we all can blow up, boom
I ain't a star yet but I'm getting close to 'em
And if you see a wack artist, do more than boo him
Throw him off the banister, shoot him on camera
Then kill his manager, than hang a banner up
that reads you can't proceed without being conceived
by one album of the nineties
On Rosecrans where you'll find me
And all my niggas is grimy, but I remain the good kid
tryna make a difference where I'm from, where you live
Oh no, we've got to slow the city down
I told the homeboy pump his brakes
He said that he'd rather put the pump to his face
Sawed off, torture
Turn the saw off, scorching
Hot where I'm from, the newscasters don't come
Another ratchet got dumped, in the trash can
I ain't done, a baby in there with it
She said postpartum did it
Molested at eleven and she always reminiscing
when he was undressing, said he'll only be a minute
That's why a nigga always kicking something with some feeling
I should have been a dentist, I should have been a blizzard, cold
Flash, pose, flash, pose
A critic paparazzi got me on my toes
I wanna jump on 'em like a tadpole
Tadpole, assholes
Tryna kill my dreams, not elevate?
Those are not my dreams, I'll be straight
with a little bit of passion
and a +drive+ like an Aston
Motivation from Nipsey or Glasses, Jay Rock
Mykestro, Bad Lucc, U-N-I
Dom Kennedy, MURS and Fashawn
Lady G, Willie B, in time
I'ma +blow+ like a motherfucker sniffing lines
Go like I've never seen a red light shine
Flow till my heart hit the flo' when I'm dying
Heart of a lion, tell 'em get in line
and pass the baton, I won't pass it back
I ain't good at dimes
If the bitch bad I could pass you a dime
Haters better duck like I'm passing a pine
Know I'm the king and I'm passing you pawns
Pad of the hill, that's a passion of mine
Promise I shine
like two mics under heavy strobe lights
I'ma need to mics just to get my point across
I'ma get my joint across, country y'all gon' want me~!</pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Ab-Soul, Jay Rock
Album:  The Heart, Pt. 3 (Will You Let It Die?) {S}
Song:   The Heart, Pt. 3 (Will You Let It Die?) 
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Kendrick Lamar]
One two, one two, one two (sup, sup, sup)
A-one two, one two, one two
One two (turn the headphones up, Ali)
One two; you mix with Dre, right? {*laughs*}
Turn the headphones up...

When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
That's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it
But I could never rewrite history in a coffin
So I'm talkin' to God, "Can you wash all these demons off me?"
This last year I've been quite similar to Aaliyah
Control my own destiny, only rapper that steered
A G5, G's give high-fives to me and say, "Kendrick, just persevere"
The presence of being real
As I lay in this four corner room staring at candles
thinkin' "How can I make an example
for this generation of Compton?" My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished 
or turnin' back to that same accomplice
My past life was a child with no act right
Tryin' to smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
Assurin' that some blossom early and some truant
Thank God for the album I idolized
+It's Dark and Plus Hell is Hot+, that's the start of this crazy ride
Two young niggas, me and Dave inside the garage
And thought we was Jay and Dame, that's the lane that we tried to drive
Truthfully, I just started rappin' to get away
I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
My nigga got hit 25 times with a K
MAKE the decision, ride the beat or ride in a hearse
Now Punch is my mentor, Top Dawg is the coach
Jay Rock is my older brother, I was there when he wrote
his name on his record deal, we had figured the coast
Would live on a pedestal, once the shit hit the store
Found ourselves scramblin', tryna figure it out
Soul told me that the record shop 'bout to go in a drought
Q ain't got a place to stay, and 'bout to sleep on the couch
We eatin' off each other tray, the dollar menu amount
Meanwhile the coast goin' hard at each other
The younger rappers had wanted some of the OGs' comfort but I ain't need it
I never screamed out the "New West", I didn't believe it
They brought each other down, I was plannin' out my achievements, hahahah
I need to separate myself to stand out, tahah
I need a better way to take your fans now, hahah
I need to kill you motherfuckers DEAD (DOO DOO DOO!)
THREE HOLLOW TIPS AIMED AT YOUR HEAD, I'LL BE DAMNED IF THE CHOPPER JAMMED NOW (DOO DOO DOO!)
And we never asked for no hand out
In the midst of it all I recall a call when you said how
We could never resolve in The Hall of Fame
And I'm with the trial with a Bible and a rifle, I play the game as I PLAN BLOW~!!
Hollaback at me, nigga
And if they said that I'm the one, why you askin' me, nigga?
Cause when the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David
And pray to God that ya make it or live your life in the matrix
Cause fallin' off is a sickness, I heard that it's quite contagious
I need to separate myself to stand out, tahah
I need a better way to take your fans now, hahah
I need to kill you motherfuckers DEAD
THREE HOLLOW TIPS AIMED AT YOUR HEAD...

[Ab-Soul]
...I'll be damned if the chopper jam NOW~!
And we never asked for no hand out
I'll take you back to that pack of Black & Milds in my hand now (SOUL!)
In the midst of it all was cooking with pots and pans out
Lookin' forward as four of us are forced to form a new clan now
Fast forward as I wait in line for this passport
The homies was still poor, was workin' at Jansport

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, whoever thought that Rosenberg would mention me to Dre?
Even Vanessa from Double XL had told him to press play
And there goes my fate, now I'm on stage with Snoop
Gave me the torch and I ran with it in high pursuit
Rapped with my forefathers, even record with Gaga too
Lyricist of the year, fuck am I supposed to do? Rock

[Jay Rock]
Laughin' at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes
Exaggerated shit that we rapped had came true
Thought I was aggravated, when Warner had let me loose
I was honest, see they was haunted when Mike Jones didn't recoup

[Kendrick Lamar]
Cool, cause niggas won't outdo us in the booth
Even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof
I came, I saw, I conquered
No shame, I blame all of this on Compton
Thinkin' about when Sherane tried to set me up
Cold game, full circle, they set up her
I put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs
The fight to ignite any wrong or right that I prolong
The story was short film, the glory of him and them
The worry of mothers that don't recover when babies killed
The trial and the tribulations, the newer +Miseducation+
The view of a body wastin', you knew somebody who ain't make it
The angry, the adolescent, the reason I ask this question
Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?
...
Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?</pre>

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you

[Kendrick Lamar]
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel 'round the atlas in this spaceship, candy-coated, my day shift's
been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The Devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing, wait up
Lampin' in Jamaica, the clouds turnin', my thoughts turnin'
Burnin' castor oil, I been determined to make an earnin'
This seed in this soil is classified
I'm satisfied when I strategize my kid's future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces, the richer the poorer
The bigger the picture, the more blood pours but

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
My fans can't wait for me to son ya punk ass and crush ya whole lil' shit
I'll Big Pun ya punk ass, you a scared lil' bitch
Tiptoein' around my name, nigga you lame
And when I get at you homie, don't you just tell me you was just playin'
(Oh I was just playin' K-Dot, c'mon, you know a nigga rock with you bro)
Shut the fuck up, you sound like the last nigga I know!
Might end up like the last nigga I know
Oh you don't wanna clash? Nigga I know
I put my foot on the gas, head on the floor
Hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, I'm on a roll
Yellin', "One, two, three, four, five
I am, the greatest rapper alive"
So damn great, motherfucker I've died
What you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
House on the hill, house on the beach nigga (facts)
A condo in Compton, I'm still in reach nigga (facts)
I'm fresh out the water, I'm 'bout to breach nigga
The five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah, mo' cars, mo' lears, mo' bars, no peers
No scars, no fear, fuck y'all, sincere
I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers, you know what the risk is
Earthed in ditches, your body revertin' to stiffness
The whole world gone mad
Bodies is addin' up, market's about to crash
Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump, know how we feel punk? Tell 'em that God comin'
And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'
Electorial votes look like memorial votes
But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
It's blasphemy, how many gon' blast for me?
I prophesized on my last song, you laughed at me
Oh when the shit get brackin', don't you ask for me
How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?
G Malone big bro, kudos to him
I was two O's from a M, tryna be big as Em
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Salmon and capers, fame and lawsuits
You lookin' at me in Chucks, I'm lookin' at y'all in suits
Me and Top Dawg playin' rock, paper, scissors in court
A real hustler lose money just to go get some more
I said it's like that, dropped one classic, came right back
'Nother classic, right back
My next album, the whole industry on the ice pack with TOC; you see the flames
in my E-Y-E's; it's not a game
And the whole world is goin' mad daddy, it's sad daddy
My only advice? Go and get you a bag daddy
Lee Baca on trial, tryna portray a boxer
Beatin' up on my niggas while the CO's watch him
Tables turned, lesson learned, my best look
You jumped sides on me now you 'bout to meet Westbrook
Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you
Just know the next game played I might slap the shit out you
Technical foul, I'm flagrant, I'm foul
They throwin' me out, you throw in the towel, look at the crowd
They (nah, I don't like that) look at my smile
I'm smirkin', calm but urgent (that ain't the style, fuck!)
So many verses, you live in denial (fuck!)
So many verses, I never run out (what?)
You makin' him nervous, the music is loud
Hoe Jay Z, hall of fame, sit yo' punk-ass down! (sit yo' punk-ass down)
So that means you ain't bigger than rappin' (what else?)
So that means no more playin' the back scenes (what else?)
My spot is solidified if you ask me (what else?)
My name is identified as "That King"
I'll let y'all worry about a list, I'm on some other shit
A difference between accomplishments and astonishments
You know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever
Y'all got 'til April the 7th to get y'all shit together

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Let's get it
Look look, on foenem</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
September 22nd, 2009
Kendrick Lamar, to... to...

Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you
Scared of you, but I will fight you
I stare at the ceiling and think about you
Curiosity killing me, thinking of when I'ma meet you
You introduced yourself to so many others, mothers, sisters and brothers
Children and babies, drive me crazy, I wonder
why you love people that love people that do right?
Is it rocket science to you, or is it just your type?
One of my biggest fears
is waking up four in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers
Or maybe a family member that you thought was cool
Or maybe a person that I'll never meet cause of you
You, son of a bitch, and I wish you never existed
And I swear I'd blow your brains out if you paid me a visit
But that's not realistic, cause you'll never write
But I'ma still send this letter off, P.O. Box
and when you get it

[Chorus]
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
because it's personal

[Kendrick Lamar]
Let me continue this letter saying I don't like you
I'm scared of you, but I will fight you
Should be ashamed of the moves you make
The pain you bring, the sorrow and the hearts you break
Every day you remind me that you're always there
cause every time I come around, someone's getting shot down
And all I say is a prayer, so help me Lord
Then the Lord talk back, I can't help you boy
That's fucked up, my luck's fucked, was cursed before birth
and what's fucked up, I gotta live my life with the hurt
of knowing that you're everlasting, dwelling upon the masses
of the earth, fatal assassins snatch your bodies
Probably, on my notepad as I write
Why the fuck you wanna take my life?
Sooner or later, I'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor
So when I write on this paper, it's real talk, so

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar as 'Death'] *screwed vocals*
Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you too
and the reason why we haven't met because I've been busy dude
But ever since grade school I watched your every move
You slipped up a few times
I gave you a pass, so don't say I ain't sympathetic
But you can bet it, your curiosity, I'ma dead it
Everybody wanna know why I act this way
Let's just say, I had a bad day
Matter of fact everyday, gotta take it out on somebody
and you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade
I was born to be a killjoy, I'm a old brat
conceived by Adam and Eve, so who you mad at?
Not me, see me, I'm just doing my job
and you ducking me is mos def an odd
So why send this letter as if I never knew you?
I'd rather knock on your door and just give it to you

[Ab-Soul talking]
It's everywhere, the streets, the corners
The coroners, the morgues
Cemeteries, hospitals
Heard about 'em when I was little
Tomorrow's not promised
Cause any day he can be knocking at your front door
War, genocide, homicide
Suicide, all coincide
Signed and sealed by the living
Make it, don't take it

[Chorus]</pre>

Album:  Kendrick Lamar (S)
Song:   Kendrick Lamar *
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

* an easy place to locate this track is the fan-made compilation "Compton State of Mind"

[Kendrick Lamar]
I can tell you what it is, I can tell you what it isn't
No more K. Dot, my mother had named me Kendrick
Fuck a stage name, that's the name that I was given
The only thing that I can identify within this bidness
I'm just a good kid from Compton that want to rap
Weighing my options, pick up a Bible or a strap?
I never killed a man, never sold any crack
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map
But this monkey on my back, y'all don't want me to win
I'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends
So just to get a dollar, will I sell my soul?
I look the Devil in the eye and tell him, hell no
They say anything worth having is worth the wait
Well I want the world, tell me how long that takes
There's no time like now, I can cut my patience/patients short
or give 'em some more gowns, I don't even want the crown
I just want a peace of mind, and nigga, when I get it
you won't get a piece of mine, won't you mind your own bidness?
A rich nigga buy anything you sell him
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell him
Well I'm a broke nigga
But still I wouldn't listen to you even if your hand was on a Bible quote, nigga
Pfttuh

See I was brought up different
Whatever that my pops said, for sure I'd listen
You said you did dirt, but I can't dig it
It don't concern you if you wasn't born in it
Oh-no-oh-oh
I swear we got to fast-forward...

Before time flies by
My new sound for '0-10 is, why lie?
And if you ain't trying to win, then why try?
Now you can low-ball or give me high five
This is I nigga, look into my eye
Nigga, I am Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, pfttuh

And that used to be a hell of a task
Now I'm ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass
my character like it don't carry a
confidence that can marry a Halle Berry or Angelina with no cash
I'm bout to cash in my thoughts
Give you a compass, then tell you get lost
What I'm bout to accomplish is something that you can't fathom
Once the 'Eves' come, they quick to stare 'Adam'/at him
Hoping I don't take they bitch, but I'm on some other shit
When I'm done, I'm tryna run the government
They are big dreams
Transition from a rapper to a human being, you can't 'school' a dean
I be tutoring artist-es, leave 'em with no audience
All cause they all oversaw it, my God
Y'all be out partying, I be stealing your audience
All because who I are, Lamar

But my first name, it gotta be Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, now let's go
But we can't go... backwards</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, yeah {*coughs*}
Kendrick Lamar, uh

Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad
I'm a thinker, not a drinker, but still I Hennessy drag
Alcohol numbs the pain like when novocaine stabs
in your arteries, pardon me but my city go mad
Via Compton California, corners with coroners and karma on 'em
Colors corresponding to gangs upon us
Common corrupted Crip and Pirus cripple the city
Triple the crime, Bible nor the Qur'an can save
Welcome, don't be afraid, your city similar right?
Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights
Stare at the sky, wonder will you live to see twenty-five?
I'm twenty-two, at twenty I knew I was against the odds
This kid named Jonathan was monitoring
his momma and sister, his older cousin, he honored him
Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishing
To Johnny, he might have been a modern day rider then
he walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a MAC-11, now his eyes is big
Fascinated by mayhem, what's his cousin to say now?
He wanna be from the hood that he's from and that's one
more gangster under the family tree, took 'em under his +wings+ like KFC
Crip crazy, rocking matching T-shirts that says "the hood made me"
No love, just spread slugs, that's the policy, the leader and the prodigy
Now shorty doo-wop, holding a oowop, hanging with rah-rahs
with blah-blahs that sit on the block catching fades and licks
Going on missions with lunatics, a ninth-grade menace
Thugging for six months, smoking like six blunts an hour
The power of banging, he was walking from... {*gunshots*}
Little Johnny

[Outro: Malcolm X] + (Kendrick Lamar)
"I think you'll find, sir, that there will come a time
 when black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
 as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
 Then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
 and this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
 And then at that point you'll have a situation
 where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
 and this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
 And this type of thinking also will bring an end
 to the brutality inflicted upon black people by (black people)
 And it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
 No federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
 It's something that the black man has to bring an end to"</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
Wow, I think y'all must have forgot or something
Like I ain't hot or something
Like I don't make your girl take off her top or something

[Chorus 1]
I'm like, ha-ha-ha-ha-hah, L-M-A-O
Ha-ha-ha-ha-hah, L-M-A-O
Laughing at haters in here
I be her favorite in here
She want to play-play
What more can I say-say?

[Kendrick Lamar]
But, mm, jumped in the coupe and I'm gone
I smell like money, I don't need no cologne
I just need me a freak that can jump on the bone
Like an X-ray technician, my rectangular prism
Says money, sex, then drugs, all cause I'm twenty-one
Like playing blackjack, picture this Kodak
Moment forever, K. Dot that dude
She sucked my dick and got frostbite, I'm that cool

[Chorus 2]
I got a pocket full of checks, plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step and diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh, Ziploc fresh
And hoes want to play-play
What more can I say-say?
But ha-ha-ha-ha-hah, L-M-A-O
Ha-ha-ha-ha-hah, L-M-A-O
Laughing at haters in here
I be her favorite in here
She want to play-play
What more can I say-say?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Yeeeaah, bottle of Goose and I'm gone
Watching her get loose like a third grader's tooth
The shit that we on is the ultimate high
'XXL' flow, that's the ultimate 'Vibe'
Park that Lambi outside just to fuck with the haters
Put the Lambi in drive, watch it peel like potatoes
Holler L-M-A-O with a drunken two-step
Like I never could pass a sobriety test

[Chorus 2]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Yeeeah, I'm in the club acting mannish
Cavalli lenses, make my view panoramic
I'm out of this world, I'm off of this planet
They don't say K. Dot is here, they say his spaceship has landed
And your access has been granted/granite, like a kitchen floor
But my kitchen's marble, I ride in the carpool
because I got two whores in the back of that roam
See they're all I need, like a layup from a loan

[Chorus 2]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, shoutout to Schoolboy Q
He uglier than a motherfucker {*laughs*}

Tire marks, tire marks, finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I'm a runaway slave, uhh
Walking on water and running on waves, God MC
Oh my God you gotta see, there's never no Is in me
Of an odyssey, I'm a block away
Fire marshals moving in, marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens, got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I'm so appalled, with a prototype with a guy named Protocol
You an amateur, they want a pro' to call
I'll damage on camera in Compton, in Canada, I don't care where ya are
Just blink twice and I'm there where ya are
like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
in an ocean full of sharks, bout to come up short
Water in the pot, throw crack rock
like bam bam nigga, have two grams nigga
Pay up or blam blam nigga, have the black cam'
We can go Dipset, +Killa Cam+ nigga
I've been around niggas, killers, pimps
You ain't been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Jumped off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in '9-6
Kick in the do'
Canines was all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Momma in the bathroom, poppa at work
Happened on a Sunday, we should have went to church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
It's gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the twenty-ten Romans' empire
HiiiPoWeR, H.P., in ya face like H.D.
And I spit like an H.K., I'ma shot like an H3
H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A.B. and Y.G.
Problem and Hootie, nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
Cause I'm going out with a fist raised
and a fistful of money, give it to the fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
with a democratic politician from C.A.
They don't wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free Js, put us in the PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
Goddamn, your call
Marketing base, where your goddamn barcode?
Stuck in the street, was dark like Harpo
Black man, tell me where your goddamn heart go?
Although I'm in the land of milk and honey
nobody never gave me shit
When I got my first chain all them niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit, get it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny
Tryna talk back and shit, like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I'm being myself, my B-F-F is a B-M-W
with your B-M in it and a stash box glove
And the medicine the doctor gave a nigga won't help
I'm at a limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a black belt
I'm better anywhere, every rapper get killed
like bla-bla-bla-bla~! Where the knife at?
Cut-cut-cut where your life at
Career's over, he's slumped over
And if I'm off beat, know I'm un-sober
That's a new flow
...
Plus-plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year
And I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I'm a raptor
That's a T-Rex in a v-neck for the rapture
I'm a factor in your facial
I'm a fracture to a fraction
of one half, and I hate math
Pastor's like Eddie Long, fucking maricone
Took me mighty long to get here, nigga, FUCK~!

Told ya I was gonna fall off Q
We recording? You got that shit?
(Yeah, yeah) Ugly, our ugly ass {*laughs*}
(Fuck all that, "Setbacks" dropping December)
Don't woooorry~!</pre>

Artist: Gunplay, Kendrick Lamar, Meek Mill, Rick Ross, Stalley, Wale
Album:  Maybach Music - Self Made Vol. 2
Song:   Power Circle
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
What is this? {Maybach Music}
I like this Maybach Music! {*laughter*}

[Rick Ross]
If Michael Jackson came alive right now
He'd ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor
{*flicks lighter, inhales*}
You niggaz Spud Webb, comin up short
Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky made off everything I deserved
The square root of a kilo is me nigga... ugh
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, I'm a motherfuckin G nigga
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music} {*3X*}

[Gunplay]
It's all on me now, as you can see now
I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
I'm at the round table, where yo' seat at?
Where yo' plate? where yo' lobster? where yo' sea bass?
We ain't never left, actin like we back
You should see us now takin pictures, actin like we rap
This the circle that'll merk you, black out, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggaz the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step mo' carefully
If I fall in the field, and ain't no more air for me
Po' some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies "fuck 'em" they know already but fuck 'em
Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle {*HA HA HA*}
You don't know na'an nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous that'll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle, fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco, then crank the 'llac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
I'ma earn 'til the last court adjourned
'Til the last gavel drop, we gon' have it locked
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
We gon' have it locked (have it locked)
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
We gon' have it locked

[Stalley]
I'm part of the small percentage of niggaz who make it out the ghetto
But niggaz tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
It's funny how they come for me when they see me livin comfortably
But when I was broke and sleepin on floors they ain't want nuttin from me
My future's so bright, but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all, but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflectin in this rockin chair
All this space created all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like? Tellin a nigga that I shouldn't be here
Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
And I'll be that raisin voice that tell the people, treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts of fear, no one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear; no one alive, no one to care
Now I got a Power Circle and now I'm on a power trip
And they callin me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit?
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit, but you won't pull me out of it
It's funny how it comes full circle, now they wanna be a part of the Power Circle
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
They wanna be a part of the Power Circle
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}

[Chorus 2X: Wale]
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in yo' past
May the kids take all your good
and your wife have class
And you realize your goals
and what's life, without grind?
Those niggaz, yo' niggaz?
Hope them niggaz, real as mine

[Wale]
There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
Once you successful they relentlessly givin you hatred
There's no applause for ya, and success is hard for ya
There's enemies envy but green my niggaz lawnmower
And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford
And I ain't thuggin, they clappin at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertainin
And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza
Jealousy's for the weak, ye ain't happy I made it?
I be feeling like brother Malcolm, just added a Nation
Allah got us cause if we holla they'll all snub us
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggaz grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle's small but regardless my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
I'm so allusive, saw my niggaz be goin through it
I guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant makes soul music
Cash rule the world, at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, see the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real, my niggaz deserve it
And we don't deal with weak squares in this Power Circle
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
We don't deal with weak squares in this Power Circle

[Meek Mill]
Yeah, Meek Milly, this Maybach <strong></strong>
Uhh~! I'm like welcome to the Power Circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggaz that'll probably merk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta tweetin, 'til you hear that chopper speakin
Kill my dog I kill your dog, we tied even I believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin you gon' be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggaz to cook up
Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hook-up
And still make the profit, the streets say I'm the hottest
and a nigga still modest, I'm just bein honest
Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
Mack in my draws fittin right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, Power Circle a mafia
Just talkin money, talkin money what you talkin bout?
Probably talkin bout us, we the only thing to talk about
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
We the only thing to talk about
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Cause we the only thing to talk about

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside the highs of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweakin, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in Y.S.L.
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggaz through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you'll never grind
I know the priors they runnin by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my moms
When they heard that Ohio state gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When the day breaks and you earned them stripes and you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
down your fate you record it that night, a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
on a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
No one fake, I'm a realest in strive, of a bilion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky, and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try but I'm finishin my shine
But pussy where it hurt you, life in the Power Circle

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Regardless of how it goes down {M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Life goes on, am I right?
Tried to warn you niggaz
I tried to warn you niggaz
It's too late now {M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Double M-G
Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect
Bow down, nigga {M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
UGH~! </pre>

Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Ab-Soul
Album:  Rapper Shit (S)
Song:   Rapper Shit
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Ab-Soul]
My back against the wall, I can see y'all fronting
Drowning in your own spit and ain't coming up with nothing
I call this shit "Rapper Shit" cause I ain't a rapper
But if I was, this ain't some shit that I could rap after
Caught up in the rapture, you call yourself a factor
You're lame, paving away, +Bob+ could +Build+ faster
I'm a real master, real massive, you just real average
I see your chain, it's strange, they wore those in the Middle Passage
And it's harder to play me than to fiddle backwards
Don't act like you knew my tactics
Cause when it hits the fan, you know I stand last
I see through your true colors like stained glass
I see the fear in your eyes when we arrive
And what's the odds of even thinking you coincide
when every time a nigga open a door you go inside
just to realize, either you're weak or someone lied
See, you spend more time boasting about what you do than you do
so by the time your shit is due it's doo-doo
And who knew that too cool fool who used to sit in the back
would slip through the crack, like dudes who went to rehab
Ab-Soul, Abstract Asshole
Black Lip Bastard, et cetera for forever
I follow no ruler, even if I'm under a drastic measure
But whatever

[Kendrick Lamar]
They say pressure bust pipes
and I ain't never had to deal with plumbing in my life, now that's a bar
Sparring with me like blasphemy to cathedral
or colliding with the diesel with your baby in your arms
You would test me but you know better
It's inadequate to go against the Jesus of Nazareth
of the rap game, and guess what, I got no cheddar
But my mind is like a wizard
I define the laws of gravity every time I get high and write a sentence
Back teeth never been in agony, but I got wisdom
I have risen from the wicked to jump on the competition, scorch ya
Third degree burns next to their sideburns, all sorts of
combustable flows, firemen on speed dial
Free the leaders of the free world with a freestyle
Free the teachers, black activists get up off your feet now
and feed off my feelings as I control my wheel
like new power steering, so sincere
Tryna duck court hearings but I got big ears
Rap peers, used to study them wishing they would fuck with me
Now they can't fuck with him, I'm wishing good luck to them
Reluctantly these critics loving me and I don't blame 'em
They say, Kendrick you gunning for these niggas
So when I pull my weapon out, I give 'em the pleasure to see me aim it
and watch these bullets run into these niggas, clear the set
I got now, I got next, give you nouns, give you verbs
Give you adjectives while proposing an agitated threat
I am most debated in barber shops all because they slept on me
Big homie fear young, buck cause when I buck I make more than a buck
Dollars come quick like a fucking nun fucking for the first time
Put me in Alaska for six months in the dark, in my heart I know sun/son still shine
Still got a skill to be found in a gold mine

[Ab-Soul]
I got an appetite for habitual liars on the mic
who with pliers couldn't get a grip on life
I spit like I sat the tip of my dick on ice, and that's intense
Imagine if I had already came twice, ain't that some shit
Pass the swisher nigga, fill your cup with liquor nigga
Fly your kite till you're gone till November nigga
Show 'em you remember nigga
Pour some Hennessy and Crown for your homie six feet underground
Smoke an ounce and turn that frown upside down
like the triangle in the panties of my gal
When Mike Jack made "Raining in Moscow" I had no style
Tommy Boy stocking on my scalp
And that was like ninety-five, now it's twenty-ten
Two years away from when they say the world's expected to end
And I ain't even begin
That's more ironic than a bum asking for 50 Cent from "Many Men", one

[Kendrick Lamar]
Too many relays for DJs to replay
I do the reject while I eject your new singlay
Hot enough to sit in hell, then unveil in heatwave
Piss on a demon with ice water
And if I lose my voice then I'm probably calling out to all P.A.
systems to assist in with the word I'm tryna spread
like county jail bread or the legs of a hoochie
And that's off top like a toupee, I'm 2Pac
coming back for doomsday, spitting at cops, go and cop my album
Get high to it, pop some valium, then turn up the volume
I influence ghettos where it says caution
and them larkins get to sparking like L.A. females that's balling
Round the time this happens often, the violence get the flare
We racing against life, the turtle or the hare?
And nobody can compare to the legacy that we bout to build
Y'all work at Build-A-Bear's office, underhand pitching with skills

[Ab-Soul]
Shit, and ain't no use in crying over spilt milk
You're dead and gone
The pall-bearers carry you and your family will carry on
And on the real, this ain't a construction site but you know the drill
We lead the league in all aspects
and we deserve more medals/metals than a magnet
Put you niggas in a hole like bad debt
Shooting three pointers with the globe, nothing but nets

[Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga, nothing but the best
Every time we hit your tape deck niggas hit the deck
I rhyme like a fucking TEC
-9, and I 'Clown Posses' if they disrespect
You looking at T-Rex snapping at 'em with Tourette's
Yeah, this the flow that killed aspiring rappers
Too late, I grab the eight and start expiring rappers
Some shit only BIG and Pac could rap after
and if they was alive, they would have to pay tithes
I am God
M.C.R. squares will disperse in despair, this is me motherfucker</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
Rare Breed, Kendrick Lamar
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up

This is for my niggas that be all blacked out
Hit the streets a hundred deep, what Rare Breed about?
Riding hard, bending corners, the girlies on us
Leave a hater scarred, big Dressers sit at the stop light
Road Glides and Road Kings deep in my hindsight
You do it right or don't do it at all
Put that candy paint on it, ride them twenty-threes homie
Custom seats, custom brakes, hit the streets and ball
Centre of attention like Bynum and Gasol, aw
You know that killer californication
when you feeling like you sitting on a ceiling, chasing
dreams, hoping this conglomerate can run the nation
It's abomination how we bomb yo' block
I'm talking Big Punch, K-Dub, Baby Slip Billy
Bad Azz, Rare Breed, we all we got
See 'em out, show 'em love, chunk the deuce, give it up
It's a lot of bike clubs but they not this hard, nope

[Chorus]
Pounding on the highway stretch
All blacked out, making sure we on deck
Might catch us on them Dressers or them Road Glides, yes
Tell the world I'm a Rare Breed baby
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up, I'm a Rare Breed baby

[Kendrick Lamar]
And it's like that to the death though
Two-oh-point and seeing decimals, I ain't lying
Pounding on the interstate in the state that shines
or we might be in a hood near you
Around the globe baby, Rare Breed under control baby
Them pipes loud, the movement entice crowds
We heat it up in the cold baby
It's three degrees out? Then you should see me out
or see bout them kitty cats and how they go meow
Ha-ha, we be the father of Harley drivers, so don't bother
Show you infants how to whip it, have a bye-bye
Posers try to hang? Then we hang 'em by the collar
Silk, lannie, Rare Breed family
Stunting hard like a black circus, voila
Breed up or speed up, get ahead
So with that said, bye-bye

[Chorus 2X]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Shouting out the one and only Rare Breed
Now Breed up!</pre>

Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
Reporting live, Compton California
The good kid

I'm tired of doing it
the same way, gotta flip it before I ruin it
Make it all make sense 'fore you put your two in it
Opinions get thrown out the window with Ron Browz
So turn me up loud so the world can hear
And when your favorite rapper rapping you should cover your ears
and go death, go death I said
Go death and stay dead, a shot to the forehead to kill 'em
But I ain't here for no ignorance
I'm militant as Martin Luther King and a penalty
Aiming for my dreams till a bullet bounce off
one of my deep thoughts and hit a nigga in the spleen
I've got in it my genes, you probably think I'm talking bout a pistol
but I'm talking bout the blood of a warrior
My nigga, what you worry for? I ain't tryna jock your swag
I'm tryna better my craft and stay relevant, yeah

[Chorus]
As time flies, hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring, I'ma
tell you why, it's important
I'm not the boring, I'ma
If I think and act like you do
the world will die from not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
the world will lose out on what's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music could take my place
in the world... The Relevant

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'd rather you call me that
than a typical artist you call wack
on a YouTube blog holding ARs and stacks
of ones, but never could be the one
to rally communities or lead a crowd of blacks
Passion is too strong, I'm pissed off
So there's a chance you get pissed on, R. Kelly was in the wrong
But that don't make you an exempt
That don't make you a no-go from hitting the fence
You ain't a blood and damn sure you ain't a crip
The crowd yell "hoe" but I ain't a pimp
I'm me, I'm free as a five-finger discount
See you on the flip side right after I dismount
If I ever feel like I ain't pushing myself
I'll find a cliff, then push myself off the edge
like a barber at the tip of your head
That's how I settle it, life or death if I ain't relevant, nigga

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
So feel free to not mind me
if you're used to boosters, drug dealers and shooters on wax
Cause most of y'all niggas fabricate facts anyway
I could easily cheat and let the four-four play like a two-on-two orgy
But I've been there and it bores me
Got to the point where it did nothing for me
At forty I want to afford not to record bullshit in my story
And I'm mad young, so I'd rather do it now before my career's done
This is pain plus glory, victory is here
If I cried, you could see strength and pride in my tears
I do it for the kids
I do it for the twenty-three hour lockdowns doing time in the pen
And my pen is the only thing I got for Hip Hop to change the game
and they'll remember my name as The Relevant

[Intro]
"This, this, this should be played at high volume
 Preferably in a residential"

[Chorus 1]
Life's a bitch, life's a bitch
But I'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
I'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
I'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
I'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
My dick hard, her pussy wet

[Kendrick Lamar]
And I'm born with my dick in the earth, you can tell me how much am I worth?
I'ma die with my heart on my sleeve, many die on their hands and their knees
And I'm taking whatever I need, and I'm raping the government fees
And you're wasting your time, and I'm speaking my mind on whatever I think
And I think that I'm Richard Pryor with priors of thirty-two fiends
And that means that I here fly higher, tell me why are you staring at me?
Matter of fact man, your eyes is wired, you inspired by Kendrick the King
Maybe it's cause I'm living my dream, man I sing what I'm living about
in the words that come out of my mouth, they requires a random routine
of being organic granite, then my access is granted
to represent the shit that I conceive, and I guarantee that I'ma bring
my mind, body and soul, and I sold all these records off being myself
And I wish you can do the same thing, man it's easier than a stripper
or tying a baby shoestring, you stringing along
And really, why you writing a song? Your passion for music is never in sync
No secret societies guided me to the world of unseen
And they tell me life is a bitch, who gives a shit? You can believe

[Chorus 2]
I'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
I'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
My dick hard, her pussy wet
I'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
(Hi hoe) I came, (bye hoe) I went
(Hi hoe) I came, (bye hoe) I went
(Hi hoe) I came, (bye hoe) I went
Bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch... 

[Kendrick Lamar]
And I see that you envy of me, enemy ghosts don't prosper
Better yet, they do die eventually, if I'm at the event you will leave
cause you know and I know that I go +H.A.M.+ even if Muslims is seen
In my rearview I'm near you, but I don't hear you, can you hear this breathe?
With an oxygen mask, and the masses keep saying I'm speaking for them
And if you can imagine my madness, then you can see where I've been
And the places the Louis has been, and I swear I've been doing this when
you was in pajamas watching B-B-Barney and-and Friends
And you couldn't harm me even with ten weapons of your choice riding in
army tanks, you shot blanks and I shot back, made your duplex bend
What the fuck you think? If I don't think then I'm right back where the city sin
What the fuck you drink? Thinking I can't write these raps in the Lions' Den
When I hear that you lying then, it's murder she wrote, ain't no hope
You go downhill man, where's your slope? Get thrown downhill tied to a rope
Tell the world to put intervals, man I swear this the antidote
And they tell me that life is a bitch, who gives a shit when you know that

[Chorus 2]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And I see that you envy of me
Don't prosper, better yet, they do die eventually
cause you know and I know that I go +H.A.M.+ even if Muslims is seen
In my rearview I'm near you
Hi hoe, bye hoe...</pre>

[Alori Joh]
Today *9X*
I feel like *3X*

[Kendrick Lamar]
Twisted up in cold heat
But courtesy of the homie Whoo Kid, chronic features
Hennessy by the two-litre, fuck a fifth
Today I'm feeling like a nigga that worry don't exist
I need some alone time, cut off my phone, get in the zone
Within my own mind, I'm gone, be back in a minute
Cruise till I hit the beach of Venice, parlay
Play the strip like an arcade while bumping some Sade
'Sweetest Taboo', my brain is a castle
built from the hands of God, oh God
I'm a free soul staring in the belly of an eagle
That's not a metaphor, that's just me hoe
They say I'm an activist rapper
I'm just a regular nigga, Jigga and Pac playing John Madden
Now picture that while I finish rolling this Bubba Kush
Reading scriptures from the good book
That's not considered a sin is it?

[Chorus: JaVonte]
As I move
I feel way better doing me, I can only do me
I hope that you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn if she, if he, if them
or they say I'm uncool
Nothing would change how I feel me today

[Kendrick Lamar]
What I compose be so potent
that if the Earth dried, I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on a jet ski and start west coasting
I'm not boasting or bragging
Not a person, I'm a dragon taking action in the heat of the night
So if the Devil came, tell him that I'll be alright
I'm so high off life that I can O.D.
Walk outside, then sniff a whole ki'
Old lady, don't call the police, it's just lil' Kendrick
walking with his heart on his 'pendix, don't be afraid to speak
So to speak, you niggas not within arm-reach
Y'all Midget Mac swinging on Shaq, now have a seat
You can never coexist with my mama's oldest, recognise my name
I got my mind right, my niggas locked in the pen
That's why my mind write ink over my brain, what's up?!

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
So let me start off the third verse
bigging up y'all favorites as I curse
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissing
Fuck you because you don't see my vision
I fucked your new girlfriend too because she's cute
and the ass looked like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossiping bitches
Fuck niggas who can't fight, so pull triggers
Fuck the new broke ass price, the cost of living
Fuck your love, fuck your hate, fuck your snitching
And whether you fuck with me or not
I don't give a fuck, you can keep your props
Fuck keeping it real, I'ma keep it K. Dot
This is me every day, Jay-Z didn't lie, fucker

[Chorus]

[Alori Joh]
Today *9X*</pre>

[Alori Joh]
Today *9X*
I feel like *3X*

[Kendrick Lamar]
Bumping some Sade
Rolling my window down, then hitting the highway
No it's not Friday, but it's my day
and sometimes shit gotta go my way
Niggas got me fucked up, thinking that my music don't 'stick' like some nunchucks
Top Dawg, and we 'All Stars' like we run Chucks
But never mind that
Take a trip to outer space, show you where my mind at
You know where my grind at
Inside of the studio, that's where I spend my time at
Fuck over the game till I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that bullshit
Haters die young, you can run to the pulpit
Pulling off to pitstop, car like a flip-flop
Bitches clap at me like they want to make my piss hot
I don't even trip though, I don't need no company
Me? I'm thinking long-term, tryna build a company
Kendrick the Good Kid

[Chorus: JaVonte]
As I move
I feel way better doing me, I can only do me
I hope that you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn if she, if he, if them
or they say I'm uncool
Nothing would change how I feel me today

[Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga, what I compose be so potent
that if the Earth dried, I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on a jet ski and start west coasting
I'm not boasting or bragging
Not a person, I'm a dragon taking action in the heat of the night
So if the Devil came, tell him that I'll be alright
I'm so high off life that I can O.D.
Walk outside, then sniff a whole ki'
Old lady, don't call the police, it's just an 'Average Joe'
walking with his heart on his 'pendix, don't be afraid to speak
So to speak, you niggas not within arm-reach
Y'all Midget Mac swinging on Shaq, now have a seat
You can never coexist with my mama's oldest, Kendrick be thy name
I got my mind right, my nigga locked in the pen
That's why my mind write ink over my brain, what's up?!

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
So let me start off the third verse
bigging up y'all favorites as I curse

Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier
Song:   War Is My Love
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
I never felt the feeling of euphoria
Pain forever, prolonged
The pros and cons of prosperity is strong
Wake up in the morning and I gotta win
Not taking the victory is my only sin
And so I send a message to your messenger
A warning shot to let 'em know I'm serious
I'm ready for a war, when I roar it can break a glass window
The only thing for sure's the perfect way to bend you
on your back, even if I gotta slither through the cracks
I can crack every code you deliver, I attack
every hole where the bomb squad sit it on a tripod
Even if he try hard, he can still die hard
Run but you can't hide, white flags
You can pull 'em out fast and tell me your last goodbye

[Chorus]
I will, I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes, and all my fight is drowning in blood
What I got to lose? What I got to prove?
I guess war is my love

[Kendrick Lamar]
Make sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothing
You know I take risk, darks clouds, I love it
Cause I can hide in the mist, hop out and crushing
every soldier you're wit, so I'm six for six
I'm sick with determination, I terminate ya quick
I lead the pack, I follow no rules
I see the traps, I know you're close to
falling on your face, unload, reload
Hand me another case, explode, explode
The fire in my eyes is waiting on your demise
I know you hope your help is close by

[Chorus]</pre>

Song:   Vanity Slave Pt. 2
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
I swear you people don't know Kendrick, you don't know him
But you say you want some more Kendrick, I'm bout to show 'em
everything inside this human being, I'm still growing
I'm a premature, baby in this crazy life that we adore
Doors on the Lamborghini, I want 'em
Can't afford 'em so I tell the swap meet to clone 'em
I guess I really am a vanity slave
I guess my ancestors turning in they graves
Burning money when I get it, fuck a life savings
Overdraft bank statements just to make a statement
When I put this fashion on, I'm a fashion junkie
Picking cotton in the country, I bought this out the country
Whips and chains, whips and chains, Jacob know my name
He call me Kunta, you my brother, we come from the same
modern world, that's your girl? I see she rocking Fendi
Try this on, if it ain't upscale then you may offend me
Copping everything in sight, ignoring they sacrifice
Amnesia if I see the Black Visa in my hand tonight
I show my dick and then I swipe, that's a punchline
They was hot and I wore ice, that's ironic huh?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Gucci Mane)
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my twenty-sixes
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me, I'm a vanity slave
(It's the Guc', cock and shoot
 Found my swag but lost my roof, BURR~! BURR~!)
Lord please forgive me, I'm a vanity slave
(See my Audemar tick as my Audemar tock)
Lord please forgive me, I'm a vanity slave (BURR~!)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Aw man, videos got me wanting hoes
Appetite for flashing lights, all I can do is pose
A black male, on Melrose
I should get blackmailed, buy my people hell Rose
Niggas that ain't had shit for four-hundred years
overcompensate by over-accessorising with gear
Many of y'all don't see my vision
I do it for the love of Hip Hop and the love of bitches
Am I a hypocrite cause everyday I'm contradicting?
I think of how I'm living, then I watch "How I'm Livin'"
I know this can't be right, my conscience tell me to stay righteous
It's unlikely to see what I like and say I don't like it
Biggest dilemma, my priorities ignoring me
I wanna move accordingly, but baby steps are premature remember?
I'm flying to the south and I'll be gone till November
to see my family tree, but this a shame I'm yelling out timber

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar] + (Gucci Mane)
Cold, oh so cold
How ironic? He bought it, then sold his soul
Is it masonic for your vice to take it's toll?
The remote control is taking control
Lift up the doors
That Lamborghini I wanted come with a dumb-ass model that in Vogues
I like 'em both, I'll wife 'em both
Take these motherfucking Jordans off, put on my Loafs
Cause nothing goes bad every time I wear (Gucci~!)
I'm getting more ass every time I wear (Gucci~!)
They tell me it's a fad every time I wear (Gucci~!)
But should I give a fuck when it bring me more coochie?
This a young nigga's pedigree, I pray the Lord can better me
If not he bout to strike me down like this my third felony
Them voices keep on telling me, Kendrick don't forget about us
I burned my wardrobe, hoping that I could live without it

[Chorus]</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
Canei Finch on the beat
Turn the headphones up, Ali
Here we go

I woke up this morning with my dick on hard
Didn't know why till I said fuck all y'all
or fuck this world, or I'ma fuck that girl
'good kid, m.A.A.d. city', watch my day unfurl
I put my life in these sentences, fucking right
It's either that or life sentences, I'm relatives with Benjamin
I used to give a fuck about my luck when I was innocent
Now what the fuck is up? I'm at your neck like a Pendleton
Nigga, I need that, bitch, I need that
Twenty-four acres and a mule, best believe that
They say he got smoked, like where the weed at
And everything you hope, bitch nigga, we that
Pockets on Kelly Price, back when it was '95
Buy a strap and then we cock it back when it's uncircumcised
Write a rap on how we just react when shotty hit the spine
Give you dap, and then we slide through your hood three-dozen times
So what's good? I'm looking for a pedicure, pink
pussy that pop, preferably the kind that don't stink
Uhh, bomb ass head, uhh, till she can't blink
and her eyes get watery, you gotta pardon me

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so damn turnt, wheeling in a two-door
with two hoes that follow me, and you know
Westside, right on time, tell them hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto though, but
Westside, right on time, only thing for sure, uhh
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door, uhh

[Young Jeezy]
I woke up this morning like fuck the world
Been hustling since I was twelve, man I've been through hell
Now these motherfuckers is tryna tell me I don't care
Tryna tell y'all motherfuckers, look, y'all wasn't there
Third posted up on the block, waiting for mail
This for my niggas posted up in the county praying for bail
Could have cost your boy everything, man it wasn't cheap
Coming for a nigga, just don't sleep, shit for the weak
Got on my Malcolm X frames, now I count my checks mayne
cause every time I speak, you hear my Malcolm X pain
Now them doors go up on that Lamb', they like judo
Don't you like your bitches with an ass? I like you hoe
First them bitches see me, I'm gone, I'm like Pluto
Plus I keep them choppers that sing, they Mars Bruno
Brown bag full of cash baby, MCM
When they ask me my name, I tell 'em MC him, straight up

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
All praise go to the most high, uhh
All fades turn into a drive-by
Part ways from the streets after fucking with police, guaranteed
Last nigga did that died, don't you, don't you, don't you
wanna live where the AK go for only 8K
minus six racks, minus one on top of that? Melee
Stomp him out, then drug him out like a date rape
Daytonas bending every corner while they say

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
All I ever wanted was a dollar bill and hundreds
and my teacher as my woman, when she smiled I stick my tongue in
Plus some cartoons and some cereal, Snoop Doggy on my stereo
Some British Knights or L.A. Gears with glowing lights, or Perry Ellis jacket
I would love a swap meet full of Chevrolets in candy paint
that's wet with Tammy on the bumper, can I hump her? Poppa tell me yes
A D.P.G.C. concert and a DJ Quik song on cassette
Twenty years later, hi hater, I'm the fucking best

[Chorus]</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
As my mind drifts and then split, like the middle of a spliff
I begin to catapult off the cliff
of the unknown, I've got a feeling in my funny bone
that we're not the same, just antonyms of another age
My soul flock with the carefree words of the wise
I +spoke+ a hundred times like a gold D
Ha-ha, L-M-F-A-O
I hate y'all but I spread love like mayo, then spread slugs
My brain matter is a brain fatter
See my vision or my vision will stare at ya
This is the future if I say so, you copping fitted caps
I'm bout to go and cop a halo, the God of rap
and I mean it, I play football with Mars
and marbles with Pluto and Venus, witness the genius
I interact with the inner-city villains
that will enter your system like a computer hack, then give you dap</pre>

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
When the sun fall out the sky
all I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me you need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me you love me

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
Fell into lust, where is the love?
My independency got tendencies of lack of trust
I look at the street corners as my new woman
Seductive as she wanna be, hands all on my garments
And luckily, being in denial ain't the case
cause I know she's unfaithful, instead I'm grabbing her waist
And every part of her is tasteful, and I know your feelings hating
In fact, you think I'm ungrateful, I know
Selfish as I wanna be, and every time you under me
I get the vibe you might need some time to grow

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
And every time that I think of your touch
Adrenaline pump, give me that rush
I'm gone like a thief inside the wind
Lord forgive me for my sins
I know she want me more, but I fiend for Benjamins
She said I found the root of all evil and lost a friend
Lost in the world of a young boy from Compton
that never knew love because love was never promised, I know
Selfish as I wanna be
And every time I'm under you, me too, need time to grow

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me you love me
Two time, baby tell me you love me</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
His eyes bloodshot red
I watched him as he took a fifth of Henny to the head in memory of his brother
Reminiscing on them playing Sega with each other
He was hurting, I could see it, plenty tears, no Kleenex
I stood by his side because that was my homie
Gave him a hug, some of his brother blood got on me
Clenching his fists on some angry shit
Stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hanging with
I wasn't sure so I gave him no answer
But I was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war
Revenge, what do say to a good friend
that just lost it and grabbing choppers out the closet?
I tried my best to make him renege, but he was like my nig'
This feeling is more than personal
I stood down, he hopped in a four-door Honda Accord
Before he bent the block he said K. Dot, you wouldn't understand

[Chorus]
These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, or war
(Or at least, try to understand) the city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle, shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, or war

[Kendrick Lamar]
Corners become monuments for the dead
Candles on the pavement, postcard read
rest in peace, the yellow tape blocking off the streets
A baby momma yelling at the police
But you don't understand, you figure that we're just a bunch of niggas
But the picture is a story untold
See this wasn't in our plans
Babies from the late eighties wasn't born crazy, we was raised that way
Put that Malcolm X book down, then raised that K
Complete chaos when we off X pills and St. Ides
Look the Devil in the face from a saint eye
Cast a 'spell' on you like Akeelah and the Bee
Every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted, mind
Substance, time is no longer an issue
We don't have it, so pass the tissue
Then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can
Then tell her you understand, but you don't understand

[Chorus]
These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, or war
(And hopefully you'll understand) the city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle, shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, or war

[Kendrick Lamar]
He came back fifteen minutes later
He said, Dot I went on one, do me this favor
Dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you
This is critical as it gets my nigga, I need you
I said alright, so what happened? Seen a few niggas slipping
and I just started clapping, I didn't care who I was hitting
That's wild shit, but anyway, I got you
I love you my nigga, make sure you hit me up by tomorrow
I woke up the next morning with a cold
Allergies got me sneezing and wiping my nose when it was leaking
Checked the medicine cabinet, looking for some DayQuil
But all I seem was some aspirins, just my luck
I got up, went to Rite Aid
Hoping that the pharmacy department had the right aid, I bought it and left
Walked to the parking lot, that's when I seen the faces of death
Said they was looking for my man with a chopper in their hand
Praying that it would jam, but you don't understand

[Chorus]
These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, or war
(Now tell me, do you understand?) the city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s (huh?)
The Desert Eagle, shotty and the Smith & Wessons (do you understand?)
Pray for me, or war

[Kendrick Lamar]
It's like, it's a revolving door
that I've been a part of my whole life
Fucked up right?</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
Mic check, Ali
The mic don't sound right

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even a shooter can get shot (Ali, get it right)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even a shooter can get shot

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh, tell 'em I got plenty arson to sell 'em
Heat by the fleet, displaying it very seldom-
ly, I write till I ignite my cerebellum
Close to the +pen+ like I had three felons
Come from a city where niggas show no remorse
and a corpse is just another homi' taking it's course
Of course my dream was to play in the final four
till twelfth grade came and I was only five-four
So now I'm a graduate looking to get hired
My pops knew a security job, he inquired
But ignorance is bliss, that's what I was told
I stopped, dropped and rolled when somebody yelled fired
Now there goes another black boy unemployed
with a lot of free time, which means he's vulnerable
to run into a lot of crime, I wrote it in my rhymes
and when I left the porch this is what I realised

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar] + (uncredited female)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even a shooter can get shot {yeah, yeah, yeah}
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even a shooter can get shot {yeah, yeah, yeah, so what's up?}
(These streets ain't none to play with
 It could get outrageous
 Got burners, .45s and gauges
 That could really get outrageous)

[Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm thinking to myself, what's next?
My security job only got me like two checks
My pops disappointed, told me I'm fucking up
Irresponsible and I needed some growing up
I told him I would go back, knowing I wouldn't go back
Working a nine-to-five is something I couldn't stomach
Surrounded by the violence, all the goons and the goblins
With ninety-nine problems I still kept it one-hundred
These streets can be rather manipulating
Especially when you're black and just turned eighteen
So what's a kid to do, when you're fresh out of school
and the negatives of the world constantly following you?
Not to mention a local henchman, Compton sheriffs all like terrorists
Osama with badges that talk arrogant
That boy fifteen fifteen and he holding a .45
Thirty years apart, thirty years before he realised

[Chorus 2]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh, soon as the beat drop
I bet some heat pop, on a block close to you
Like a relative, you sipping Belvedere
while these niggas planning to rob Mr. Belvedere, yeah
I'm a good kid tryna stay righteous as Martin Luther
But it seems like all my friends eventually become shooters
And niggas banking on you is something that you'll get used to
You can either fight back or run home and grab your Ruger
Whatever you do, just make sure that you willing to do it
Being too indecisive can get you killed inside your Buick
cause you stopped at the light, five minutes from midnight
with no tinted windows, that nigga surely had shot through it
You tell me you listening, but you don't hear the music
Call you Billy Hoyle when turmoil was near
This is the realest right here, when I lost my very first job
My pops said "why?", I said I couldn't aim for the sky
Cause even shooters can get shot, get shot

[uncredited female]
These streets ain't none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners, .45s and gauges
That could really get outrageous</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
I return before tables get turned
It's my turn, spur of the moment
They reproduce my sperm and try to clone it
Stand firm, bumping the The Firm 'Phone Tap', I'm on it
I slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent
You can't fuck with the horse power, you're woofing too much
You're bout to go hoarse coward as soon as I buss, pause
You put your hands on a broad, then telling me you can brawl
You thought you saw me when you saw 'Saw', frightening
More reckless than a paisa driving without license
Hitting your new truck, then leaving you hiking
They said no, the industry let it go
I cracked the window, they hit the back door like trick dices
Sticking and moving, and moving and sticking the prices
Upping the ante before I'm an antique
I promise you'll hear me clear, even if you need three ears with Tyson
Gripping the panties, big booty, no whammies, they dyking
I'm liking them all, I'm sifting through panties, haters will spike it
Voicing opinions, but holding laryngitis
But I don't hear 'em, I'm a winner by law
Track 'em down like a subway when they sub-par
Sub-zero every time I jump in the synagogue
Send an angel, send a God, I don't make it look hard, I know
I just let the thoughts take its toll
More 'sentences' than Level IV yard
Bogard, go hard, black tar, concrete
Tom Vick, times Papi Mason, times three
Uncle Toms need toms to stomach atomic bombs, or die from my Wizardry
RZA, GZA, Method Man, I'm a 'Killa Bee'
Killer be killed, make your embassy yield
This is not your cup of tea, and oh
They say waters run deep
Dive in Bermuda triangles and you'll see us
We must, dust behind, emcee's duck
Deduct, revenue decline when we touch-
down like a running back's grind, can you keep up?
You keep a safe for keep-safe? That ain't safe, bla~!
Compton

Album:  Rap or Go to the League
Song:   Momma I Hit a Lick
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(I want it, I want it, I want it)

(Chili, chili, chili, chili)
(Way up countin' chili)
(I'm up countin' chili)
(Tell my momma I hit a lick)
(Tell my momma I hit a lick)
(Momma, I hit a lick)
(Momma, I hit a lick)

I'm coming, baby, send the address
Progress, never digress
Your last man didn't pass the 'fly test'
I eat rappers, no digest
Fuck a piece, I want the whole pie graph
Money taller than a giraffe
Feng shui by the mic stand
Have you ever had two one-night stands?
I'm an emperor, very sinister
Someone smoking on indica
Fox on me like Vivica
I pray before a meal, spiritual

brought a case, bought a big face
They want my spot, they wanna switch place
They want the game, wanna sip Ace
Bow, bow, straight to the face
I'm takin' my lawyer, the whole briefcase
Makin' a play in the police face
They were like, "Man, he fresh"
I was like, "Go DJ"
When they play your new shit
I was like, "No DJ!"
You can go on and skip that
I buy a house and flip that

(Chili, chili, chili, chili)
(Way up countin' chili)
(I'm up countin' chili)
(Tell my momma I hit a lick)
(Tell my momma I hit a lick)
(Momma, I hit a lick)
(Momma, I hit a lick)

Fall off in this bitch, I ball off in this bitch
My commas hit the floor, you crawl off in this bitch
I do a hundred more, you stall off in this bitch
And then I vÃ¡manos, applaud me in this bitch
C-notes, vinos Pinots all up in this bitch
MaÃ±ana in this bitch, y'all are not familiar
Y'all are immigrants, the law not in this bitch, I

Fuck the opp, no competitor
got into it with my bitch last night
She was right, but I had to get at her
Two popped bands and they dance on my waist
Hit the face, that's the editor
I don't take pics on a jet, lil' nigga
This shit regular
G-5's all in my back yard
Situated crew in the nose bleed
And my pockets holdin' big protein
Big, big protein

I levelled up past 5-5
Your favorite rapper Desperate Housewives
Play with me get your chastised
Milk 'em all 'til I'm satisfied

Get involved 'fore I strategize
Switch the flow 'cause I know niggas like identity theft
Oh you got like me? (Say less)
Oh, you pop like me? (Say less)
Mask keep a nigga (In Check)
Huh, swag keep a nigga (With checks)
Huh, tags on my wall (Success)
Huh, played the underdog, now I flex

(Chili, chili, chili, chili)
(Way up countin' chili)
(I'm up countin' chili)
(Tell my momma I hit a lick)
(Tell my momma I hit a lick)
(Momma, I hit a lick)</pre>

Artist: 50 Cent f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Street King Immortal
Song:   We Up
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, uh-huh
They don't do it how we do (do)
Niggaz ain't on the shit we on (we on, we on)
Everything new (new)
Spikes on the Louboutins ('boutins, 'boutins)

[50 Cent]
I'm 'round the bullshit like a matador
I'm used to the bullshit, it don't matter boy
Corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth
Build with the gods and double knowledge of self
Entrepreneur visions, Moulin Rouge religion
That pussy make a weak nigga break down
So what you want, the cheese or the cheeks?
You want the cheeks, she want the cheese, bitch gotta eat
I'm havin the epiphany you niggaz ain't shit to me
Worse than the scum in the slum I'm from
I'm a Southside nigga, yeah I'm 'bout mine
You'll be that next nigga coroners come outline
You ain't made of what I'm made of
You a bum nigga with a bum bitch, your shoes come from Bakers
You counterfeit fraudulent fakers
What kind of rich nigga bitch look like that?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You all know when we pullin off the lot
Brake, hit the button then we pullin down the top
Shine's on stuntin and I'm pullin out a knot
Strapped with the Glock, won't pull it out a lot
But front, I'll make it pop
They don't do it how we do (do)
Niggaz ain't on the shit we on (we on, we on)
Everything new (new)
Spikes on the Louboutins ('boutins, 'boutins)
We up nigga~!

[Kendrick Lamar]
Visualize everything I needed and dream (uh-huh)
Penalized every hoe nigga that have a scheme (what else?)
Guns in your video gets you locked in the beam
Yeah I'll kill a nigga quick, no worries, my record clean
Murder one become manslaughter soon as they brought up
Charity work, parkin tickets and no charges
Fuck nigga, you fucked over your father
when he gave you a dick, should've been a bitch in pajamas
I made my first million fuckin dollars
Bought a Bible, aw yeah, God got me
Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and binoculars
I'm scared, this shit don't happen to everybody
I'm on Instagram lookin at your favorite singer
Debatin on should I fuck or jump on her single
20 thou' she got a hell of a ad-lib
I'm in her mouth like I knew I can have kids
K-Dot

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Good pussy for dinner, b-bomb kush for breakfast...
D-d-deep-colored VS stones around my neck bitch...
It feels like a nigga dreamin
Seat back, music bumpin, niggaz leanin
Bull's-eye, that's what we came for
The bread, now a nigga run the game boy
I should've sent the broad to report what's in the yard
Aloof livin, I came up so hard
No pain, no gain, it's embedded in the brain
I'm in it for the grip, motherfuck the fame

[Chorus]

Don't make it slam on you like Amar'e
M-Zone, Rida Gang, end of story
Oops, that's your baby, my bad I'm sorry
She call me daddy too, we should be on Maury
Everything you aren't, fly nigga soarin

You so special, bedroom or restroom
Just keep performin
Go girl, I'm 'bout to film a movie
and guess who is starrin? (Ahh~!)

[Chorus]

Good pussy for dinner, b-bomb kush for breakfast...

Song:   Enjoy (West Coastin')
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Warren G]
9th Wonder, Warren G
It's classic y'all

Yeah, give respect to the trigger finger
I've been pushed that line since grade school, a fool
Since I touched down, bitches they want to fuck now
But can't get it, she got ass with her nose like... Pippen
My pimping, it ain't never scared
Got real estate over there and hustle over here
Dare a nigga try to take it, he gon' fake it till he make it
Shorty break 'em like a bracelet, that's real talk
Yeah, don't you snitch if you get caught
You already know if you do then you dead
And now niggas in the hood trading kush for your baby mama throat
But suck it up bitch, deal with it
Huh, ain't no glitch in my computer
Banging beats for the Gouda, paper plains, no hookahs
Yeah, I'm driver and the shooter and the taxi
I dare you motherfuckers get at me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I dare you motherfuckers get at me, yeah

[MURS]
See I grew up with the blue team before there was a Ustream
Seen a lot of niggas knocked out over shoe strings
Rhyming on these beats since the nineties, I'm a factor
Here with this career until I'm in the hereafter
Classic with this mic like Mike when he was blacker
And you? You remind me of me when I was wacker
I read lines and bring drama like an actor
But I'm so Hollywood that you would think that I'm a rapper
You think I got it backwards? It really doesn't matter
Producer meets the rapper, he's the former, I'm the latter
Spacing out these bars so you niggas can climb on
I'm proof that you can still make loot and keep your rhymes strong
Burn out the industry as hot as my performance
Be the mainstream dream meets the nightmare of normalcy
The anti of everything cool
Still most likely to succeed cause there ain't no rules, yeah

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, my nigga we out chere, photo cutlass
Another known for your luggage, don't trip
You fabricate to the public, we don't believe shit, believe it or not
Call your bluff, then leave your ass with knots
The juggernaut is in your rectum, call Pac and resurrect him
I'm sure to cause a spectrum, especially when my mental telepathy
start to F 'em, A.K.A. fuck 'em
A.K.A. nothing's in my way once I start b-b-bucking, fuck up your function
and your house party, my life surely about fortune and vice
If the Feds caught me I tread softly, judge toss me life
And your high-tops and my posse came to properly fight
Everyone's watching alright? If you're not watching me, lie
Still my big cousin a kite
Got my shit buzzing when shit wasn't a doorbell, an insect or a light year in sight
Amen, now won't you be a man and pay respects
Enjoy as we progress, destroy your baby steps
Son {*8X*}</pre>

This what you really want, huh? (Turn me up Ali)
Is this what, this what you want, huh?

Black Lip Bastard, pass me your password
So I can hack inside your brain, see I too have gone insane
Before I fall, I'm sure to curse you all in Jesus' name
Lead showers, Anna Pebble hour, bitch, 'Stand the Rain'

Is this what you really want? (Let me get it back Ali)
When we do in-
When we do interviews, don't ask me about no movement (yeah I'm good)
No crews, no, no posses, no clicks
If it ain't about T.D.E. I don't wanna hear that shit, bitch!

Look inside my parking garage and see a collage
of every person I despised since the moment I turned five
Calculate my steps and strategically took my time
Even falling off I land on the ass of Nicki Minaj (so soft)
Eat that 'Pink' pussy like it's 'Friday'
Bust one, 'Roman Reload', then smoke to Sade
And somebody tell Rihanna too
I need that vagina too (hey baby)
Don't fucking take me for some kind of fool
I'm kinda the reminder of knowing Compton ain't kinda cool
Good kid, mad city, mountain tops couldn't see my views
Counter tops we hop over, hit the register, then we move
I hope this shit can register on a regular soon
before I climb this pedestal and make you catch my fucking stool (bitch)
K. Dot, leave 'em grieving on evening news
Even when society break even, I'll break rules

[Ab-Soul]
I told niggas, caught wreck, then I towed niggas
Fold niggas like clothes and drawers nigga
Homie chose to go toe-to-toe, I had to break his leg
like a cliche to rock a show, is that over your head?
Niggas stretching the truth like they choose to do yoga instead
Either that or they depressed, eating yogurt in bed
Soular system, grab a space shuttle and stay subtle
The bass bit the bait, I'm straight, you a gay couple
I ain't thirsty for the deal, wait and make 'em pay double
Anxious when I'm banking on the table, I need a muzzle
You're basic like cable to a satellite dish
You was running L.A., now you out of there like Fish
What more can I say? I'm a Bastard with Black Lips
Black shirt, black shades, long black dick
I'm awkward dog, I'm tryna bargain shop at Saks Fifth
Swung two axes and knocked the Earth off axis, ask me (Soul)

[Chorus 2X]
And all we do is do it
All we do is do it
All we do is do it
All we do is do it
(Nigga, squadddddd...)
And all we do is do it

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
This what you want?
Alright, guess what, I'ma let Puff Daddy talk to you
The real Puff Daddy

[ScHoolboy Q]
Figg side, black nine, black lips, smoke tiiiiime...
Fuck this rap shit, I'm acting
Yeah, sucking on titties since I was eight
Hoodie with my shades, I ain't tryna be fake (fuckers)
So don't be talking to me pussy
Running your gums like you be loc'ing when the world know that you're nookie
Rookie, softer than if you fabric
I won't have it, when the gun draw get ra-ta-tat-tat-tat-tat, tatted
Ughh, know my niggas moving
You hesitating to hit the lick, what the fuck is you doing?!

[Ab-Soul]
Perpetrating, bitches popping Percocet and percolating
Freelance for God, but do the work of Satan, whatever works
I'm clever with the words if you haven't noticed yet
Light years ahead, I'm bright and I like to get oral sex
Soul Brother Number one plus one
Getting fed/Fed like where drugs and guns come from, uh

[Jay Rock]
All we do is do it, shitting on the competition
Taking heads off, this Hannibal Lecter music
You niggas don't move me, you niggas just movies
Cut straight to them credits and hit you with an uzi
Peel off in a dually, truck bed full of toolies
Get home, smoke, poke on some coochie
I'm just fucking around, enough with them fairy tales
But I bust heads for real, go head {*cardiac flatline sound effect*}
I'm Jay Rock, you norm niggas beneath me
How you gon' dance with the Devil with two left feet?
Peep, thinking you sweet, but you weak
Talking out of turn will leave all of your teeth in the street
Momma taught you better, never clash with a giant
unless you David, remember my nigga, I'm not Goliath
Feel the wrath of this titan, hit some water, call it Poseidon
Wig out, then hit your ass with a trident
Money on the table my nigga, you know I'm all in
If rap was a drink, you wine nigga, I'm all gin
Hunnit proof, recruit a hunnit troops who love to shoot
No fluke my nigga, you know that's what us hunters do
East side up, Watt city mayhem
Choppers that spraying from A.M. to P.M.
I'm the silent assassin of the four headed dragon
Black Hippy blasting a .50 out the back of the Benz wagon
Toe tagging wack rappers off G.P.
You can't see me, your vision ain't 3D
You smoking on that seaweed, we rolling up that kiwi
In the backwood lighting, we high for like three weeks
You paying for that pussy, but we always get freebies
Top Dawg that hoe and throw it like a frisbee
It's history, you know the night and day is ours
Top Dawg conglomerate, HiiiPoWeR, bitch

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Is this what y'all really want?
This Black Hippy shit what y'all really want?
Wh-when I'm in interviews, don't ask me about no crews, no posses, no cl-
Don't tell me who getting it
I don't give a fuck, nigga, I just paid-
I just paid six figures in taxes nigga, off Section.80
On some independent shit
Uncle Sam talking bout he the one with lost relatives
Nigga, fuck you
K. Dot said it, not Kendrick
Ab-Soul the rawest muh'fucker on the planet nigga
T.D.E., Soular system, Control System, biatch~!

Song:   Blowin Them Horns
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Ab-Soul]
Hey, welcome to DA nigga
I really thought I was a drummer for a second there

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Follow me home, see where I was rose
Like the one in 2Pac's song that grew from the concrete
Half a line in Del Amo on cross streets
Baby baby mommas strappin' babies in carseats
Niggas failed art class, still they'll draw heat
Design a murder scene faster than an architect with a masters
One out of three niggas you know slang, that's a accurate fraction
Sunday dinner denim for packin' a mac in
Cheese in the pockets of potential rocket scientists gone bad
Like good girls movin' too rapid
Had it not been for the social status we after, our
Minds could've been on more than after hours
Some of us become legends, some are labeled as cowards
Others fall in between, I say I'm a king
Now you can disagree or kiss the ring
Either way nigga's kneel to my feet, don't be late
And if you make it in time to hear the trumpets, I
Know you gon' love it cause I love it
What's that?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
My city blowin' them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Who wanna go 15 in a Del Amo park alley
Used to battle with the pep rally
Rest in peace Prospect, I miss you like a missile
I can vision you blowing up
I launch it in your memory soldier
Ask capital Z about snap capital G
How we used to wear triple A's and Footlocker T's
Two toned fitteds from Swap Meet
Prepaid Nokias would light up antennas at the AMC movie theater
Back when the bitches wouldn't holler
I was short 75 cent, he threw me a dollar
Can't forget J Silk, my ace boon coon
On me JT would've been proud of you
We used to mob to McDonalds every day after school
Or Shakey's for pizza if our allowance would allow it
I was wildin' saggin' with the crips I had no business
I learned, job or no job your ass better be with the business
I became an alchemist over instrumentals
I'm Jim Dear over here, that's the mayor say your prayers
It's C-A-R-son, daughter, father, mother's own
Turn my shakin' haters off and I'm right at home
And if you at home with me and hear the trumpets
I know you gon' love it, cause I love it
What's that?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
My city blowin' them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
How you like your stay so far?
Is it all it's cracked up to be?

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
If you ever caught the Carson Circuit
Ditchin' fifth period to hit the mall, then I hope you hearin' this
I do this for y'all, cause y'all can relate to me, you're my family
If you went to Cheapwood, Frog Acres, or Bannana Lee
And still hit the ARCO on Del Amo in central for gasoline
Chances are we know each other well
Not the one for wishes or for fishes, more like good
If you touched ever Carson corner I once stood, then would you
Just open your ears and hear the trumpets, I know you gon' love it
Cause I love it

[Ab-Soul]
Sound so beautiful, don't you agree?
Really feel like, really feel like I'm the king of Carson right now man
For real, nothing y'all niggas could tell me

[Intro: Ab-Soul]
As we proceed to give you what you need, T-D-E

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q & Ab-Soul]
Omega, Black Hippy came through to switch flavors
Wake and bake no taters
Pa-pass me the ketchup I'll homestyle fry em'
You niggas better catch up as swift as I am
I was born in Zion
I defeated the Lion, soul made of iron
Yeah, Soul made of iron
Now a nigga talking, now you can't fold when you trying
Try for triumph
Survive by any means necessary even if it means dying
Dying! Fuck the world missionary, Malcom got popped
Obama got in office, and I'm still on the block
Ain't shit changed,the grinding never stops
Call it progress, and the reason why the chicks always fall in our nest
Two niggas getting high
Heh! Flying objects. Hehehaha! Yes!
We got next, now forever the hippy is black interrogated by (By!)
Instrumentals that give me a rhythm
Put the maze together and blaze
Don't be afraid, (Aye), See this is how we do
Would say I thought you knew but that would not be true
In fact, Be Q
You fags are through and like all of you teachers thus far
I'm passing you (Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh)

[Hook: Ab-Soul & Schoolboy Q]
Black Hippy! Black-bla-b-b-bl-Black Hippy
Soul!
Black Hippy, Black-bla-b-b-bl-Black Hippy
(yeh) Black-bla-b-b-b-bla-b-bla-b-bla-b-bla-b-b-b-Black Hippy
Please fix ya face, we rolling up so much, anticipation
We finna shock the nation, Oh Shit! Constipation!
Fuck bitches, fuck hoes, fuck bitches fuck hoes
Fuck bitches (We finna shock the nation) fuck hoes
Fuck bitches, (Constipation)fuck hoes, fuck bitches, fuck hoes
Fuck bitches, fuck hoes, fuck bitches, fuck hoes (As we proceed)

[Verse 2: Jay-Rock & Kendrick Lamar]
Activist
(black hippy) Rebel without a cause
Full clip left you stiff like a manikin
Hit him in his temple, left him at the Taj Mahal, What you on
I'm on some other shit, feeling like I stepped off the mother ship
We sabotage the government, CIA gotta evacuate when we done
The state troopers would call off the shooters at dead run
It's going down I said
Boogie down, down
Boogie down Bronx
In a black borrow hound
Bumping Biggie like
Pac ain't dead
Two side call it Twenty-two (Ugh)
I'm twenty-two and I rap like twenty zoos
Straight animal
Ace Ventura couldn't find no cure
So raw probably bite off the face of Hannibal
Protein shakes, acid, and manure

Song:   Day in the Life
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Ab-Soul] & (Kendrick Lamar)
My nigga, do you have a gas can?
(The fuck I'm gonna do with a gas can, nah, nigga what?)
It's just been a long ass day, man
All I need is a gas can
(Na, try down across the street, I think that nigga keep one, I don't know)
I'm finna head over there and I'mma be right back
(Fuck what you doing, man?
Knocking on the door extra hard and shit like you just stressed out or something)
My nigga, I don't even know where to begin, dog
(What happened, man?)

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Look, I woke up this morning feeling fucked up
What else is new? Like God be like, "To hell with you"
To tell the truth, I ain't been to church in like three or fo'
Years, not months, have mercy on my soul
Threw on the wife-beater, put a fitted on my skull
Took a long ass piss, grabbed my shades and hit the door
I had half a blunt left from last night
I lit that bitch up like a lightbulb and got right
Started to orchestrate my day like a maestro
I should hit the lab, I got verses like the Bible
I heard hip hop need revival
It's been camouflaged like the mascot for Geico
In that bullshit, I took another pull quick
My mind flooded like a fucking swimming pool is
Went back in the house, raided my mom's refrigerator
But everybody's on a diet and my stomach ain't quiet
I said, "Fuck it", hit the shower like a jackpot
The weed got my teeth off-white like crack rock
Toothbrush from the 99 cent store
I got a million dollar smile, it don't make sense though
Threw on my army fatigue shorts and a T that say "Peace Not War"
Now everybody eyeing me
I don't know if I need an iron or it's the irony
And by the way, I'm at the gas station now
But not to get gas, just another black and mild
Shit this half a half a tank gon' have to last until Monday
And it's Tuesday, the bitches still want me like a bouquet
I hit my nigga Agent, he want to roll up two Ls like Cool J
I'm like, "Alright, cool, Jay"
But I gotta be at work by 3, it's midday
I can't go in smelling like weed, he said, "Okay"
Stop by the cheap tobacco store, two swishers for a dollar
And when he meet me, we finna get high, like a greeting
He told me, "Drop five", I said, "I got you next time"
Long story short, I bumped my head on cloud nine
And I'm chilly chill even when it's hot outside
Rode to the studio rather blasted
I spit like a dragon that'll leave a fan flabbergasted
That's when my gas and my check engine light
Clicked on at the same exact time I signal right
And that ain't right, I got shit to do today
Cause any day you could be attending my eulogy
Got to the studio when everybody left
I saw a note that read, "We went to go work on Detox with Weezy F"

[Break: Kendrick Lamar] & (Ab-Soul)
My fault nigga, I actually came up with the idea to write that
(You laughin' but that shit ain't funny man)
It was funny at first but

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
A day in the life
Of mister soul brother number deuce
Damn he nice
I'm thinking if you only knew
You could fuck with it or middle fingers up to your whole crew
Tell 'em the regular nigga said it and that it
A day in the life
Of mister soul brother number deuce
Damn he nice
I'm thinking if you only knew
You could fuck with it or middle fingers up to your whole crew

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul] & (Kendrick Lamar)
Now it's 2:58 and I'm running late for work
Running meanin' stuck in traffic cause the Home Depot is finna jerk
I been in the same position before
Manager said it better be my last time, but it won't
I clocked in around 3:10 and I'm wishing I didn't
Cause UPS just brought in this big ass shipment
And for those that don't know, I work at a record store
And I make hot records (That's a sick ass gimmick)
Finished the inventory then I logged on Myspace
I had one download and 'bout 16 plays
5 friend requests from sucka MCs making a name
I signed out and had to question my aim (You weak nigga, that's all)
This old-timer walked in and we got to talking about Eric B and Rakim
And the perm on Al Sharpton
Osama bin Laden, Obama in the office
And he looked me in my face and said I'm destined for fame
Told him I do music, he like, "Whatever you do, do it
And don't blink, the moment you close your eyes, you'll lose it"
Word to wise, that was some great advice
That I took like I stole it, then my head sort of swollen
I guess that's why I shits on 'em like a cleansed colon
Told the rest of the shoppers we finna be closing
I locked up like Akon and hit the street
It's 8 PM, and I ain't had shit to eat
All day, KFC, snackers a dollar each
Bar-b-que and nacho cheese
I bought 4, ate 3, gave one to Top Dawg
I would've had one for Punch but he moved like a sloth
I'm back at the studio now if I lost ya
And everything's straight, you can thank great posture
Hit my lil momma up cause I'm trying to cut
But she on the rag and I don't mean a bandanna
She told me come through, she gave me head like Rihanna
And I deserve a standing ovation for my swagger
Chuck the deuce, headed for the car to finish off the night right
But it wouldn't start

[Ab-Soul] & (Kendrick Lamar)
Laugh it up nigga, laugh it up man
Shit ain't funny man, that's why I need that damn gas can
(Gas, nigga, you gotta put 5 dollars not 3 in)
Shit nigga I ain't got 5 dollars to put in!
(That'll get you one gallon, nigga)
Whatever man, bullshit dog, keep laughin'
(Tryin' to save that extra dollar for that menu
For the McDonalds menu nigga ain't gotta cut all the time
Nigga you gotta put the whole 5 in it)
You gon' shoot me 5 or what? Fuckin' bastard
(I know you're on a budget, but damn)

[Ab-Soul]
Yo-yo-yo-yo, yo-yo
Back when I first grabbed that pen, I told myself I was gon' win
And I ain't know when, but it was gon' end
up happening, I want in
So you can take your top five list, dead or alive, and put me after Em
I'm a fucking genius, gripping my fucking penis, living this life
You can't tell me nothing, still ain't really got no money, fucking right
I'm all about that real, about that real, this ain't no motion picture
I tell you how that feel, how that feel, even when the odds against ya
They wanna see me wearing Polo drawers, put two chains on, and that ain't wrong
But that ain't me, I go too damn hard, I don't need clothes or jewelry
to stand out, black lip nigga with his hair wild, too damn proud
Been killing this since Cam made 'Oh Boy', oh boy, I'm the man now
Huh, T.D.E. put the money in my hand, ain't shit free
This business is quicksand and I won't sink, put the pistol in my hand I won't think
Blaow, blaow, blaow, rest in peace, you just made room for the next to be
I've never been afraid to say what I wanna say when I wanna say it, OK then
Furthermore, we do this for y'all, rap is stressing, but it pays great
That is until you lose appeal and your release date get date raped
Stay safe, hold your head, I got two fifths and a loaf of bread
Feed the people, food for thought cause we are equal, who'd have thought?

[Chorus: Ab-Soul] + (Kendrick Lamar)
They wanna share my light *8X*
(You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light) *2X*

[Ab-Soul]
Uh, I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z, now I feel I can run laps round Jay-Z
Nas ain't seen nothing this 'Nasty', BIG and Pac got it coming when I pass too
You got the mic, I ain't the one you wanna pass to, my niggas say my new shit past due
I paid dues, even got that shit tattooed, HiiiPoWeR on another plateau
I know you know we need a few plaques too, the brand new Niggas With an Attitude
Pop in Compton or Timbuktu, I might even sell my new shit for ten bucks too
Too ill when I jot these words, true eel when I shock the world
I know life's a bitch, when you know life's a bitch then that's not your girl
Cold shit, I'm hot though like coal get, Ab-Soul
This is a shift in paradigm, I remember when I couldn't spare a dime
Now I step in with a pair of dimes, on Ps, y'all know me
Flow like water, admiralty, the best author ever to breathe
Uh, and as we proceed to follow these dreams, I ain't losing no sleep
No-no on them No-Doz, and it's no-no if it's no dough
So high, but I'm Soulo, two cups and I sip slow
Taking my time, we don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, now let's go

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Time and time I drop line for line, but only time will tell
If I ever go Columbine and cop thirty nines and cock back and kill
See the truth is, they wanna know how close me, Dre and Snoop is
or how the show fits when they choose this to be 2Pac, but truth I give two shits bout
expectations or critics hating, shit, I just put moms on vacation
Bitch you never know my new location, it's across nations, court cases
get throw out, so tell the motherfucking king dethrone now, I am ruler
I am highness, the Price Zamunda, I am the shit like what the prune does
Black on black tint like Kinte Kunta, black is back bitch, I'm kin to Kunta
Black on black crime, resent the shooter, bla-bla-bla, I intend to mute ya
Racks on racks, I don't rap on tracks without my A-game so please don't ask me
about no pressure, bitch see the grip on my fingertip, I can hold this coast together

24/7, 365
Motherfucker I'm still right on time
Oh you thought you had me all figured out?
Take it from the horses mouth, you'll never understand me
I told you my Plan B is to you win your hearts before we win a Grammy
+These Days+ ain't shit changed: different toilet, same shit
and I drank a whole gallon of laxatives by accident just to shit on you has-beens
Hadn't it been for my past tense, I wouldn't be rappin'
See these streets made me, broke me down, built me up
drove me crazy, made me hungry, made you hate me, but FUCK love~!
It don't make dollars, it don't make sense/cents nigga!
By the way, that's DJ Quik nigga!
Respect or check it
+These Days+, I'm a little more focused cause y'all cracked the door
and I kicked it open, yellin' get the FUCK DOWN or I will shoot!
I TOLD YOU {*gunshots*} NOT TO MOTHAFUCKIN' MOVE!
Be another example
I'll take the whole industry hostage if I have to
I'll sabotage this game, a good kid? Yeah that's only in my mama's eyes
I seen a dead body at five and that shit made me traumatized
So +These Days+, a little blood on my hands ain't nothin' compared
to hoppin' out a minivan, with a mini 22 3's and the homie TuTu
and two more YGs - ohh nobody got time for that!
These days it's only time for rap!
So Herbert Anthony Stevens
You make or break bread before we break even
Before they broke our records we broke records and wrote pieces, of history
So +These Days+, these accolades that's meant for we
It's only truth that this shit was meant to be!
T.D.E!

[Interlude: Ab-Soul]
Shit... what more did you expect? HiiiPower
For the most part, we go hard for the respect
I'm obviously ominous to my competition
and if I ain't better than Kendrick than nobody is then
We shared our life with you, shared our light with you even in the darkest of hours
In hopes that one day, just maybe, one day the world'll be ours
Ha, and now they look up to us like towers for rhyming like we had super powers
They should've never let us in these offices...
Knowin' good and goddamn well how well we've been duckin' officers
Laughin' at the scraps they offered us in the past
And now we toast champagne to the thirst we never had!
I had my ups and downs, but I always left right
Rest In Peace Alori Joh, Top Dawg, for life
And ohh yeah... Soul~!

[Intro]
Hey girl, haha yeah shit, light that up
Haha, I'm too high for it right now though
I'm too high, you got, you got some more moscato?

[Ab-Soul]
Yeah, she a mean girl, I'm a nice guy
We all know opposites attract like a rail road, and I like
you to do anything you please when you with me, mama
Let's head home, crack a bottle of the Sutter Homes and hit some trees, why not?
Where your head at? Hope it's in the gutter like mine, not where you find rats
Talking bout where you find ecstasy, come on have a lil' bit of sex with me
Can I hit it in the morning, till the sun/son has fallen like a newborn?
Baby you stalling, you know you want all this long dick
Oh shit, might want to make you my missus
like I lost it, peek-a-boo
Lady your smile light up the room, Pikachu
You could put a nigga in a tomb (what?), peek at you
Let's pop this cork, let me rub on your neck till Victoria's Secret get all wet
and Victoria's Secret safe with me, let Victoria's Secret leave your legs
I know you had a hard day baby, relax you mind
Shit, soon as Christ turned water into wine everything was fine

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
When things get hard to swallow, we need a bottle of moscato
Puts me in the mood for your loving, you love it
We can even do it tomorrow, just bring a bottle of moscato
Puts me in the mood for your loving, you love it

[Kendrick Lamar]
Haha, I know we said P&P baby
But now we on something new

Uh, guess who's back in this motherfucker looking like a motherfucking Chi-town pimp, alright?
Make my money flip, make my money flip, make my money flip, I'll be in the gym all night
Came in the game with a dollar and a dream and an AK clip with an infrared beam
I pop that trunk, make everybody scream for the missing punk on everybody's screen
Ain't nothing changed but the ends I'm holding, my dick is big and my nuts is swollen
I don't know if you've noticed but a nigga be rolling with bad bitch and the bad bitch be rolling
dolphin pills and moscato spills, everything she need to get her thrill
No Hennessy on the bartender bill, just good wine and a good place to chill
I feel I might get loose tonight and fuck your girlfriend
I mean I feel she might come through tonight, plus her girlfriend
In a five star suite with a five star freak, slinging that dick while baby eat
on her punani, oooh mamis look at you bodies, I'm geeked
Having a good time, put my pain in a motherfucking bottle
A chain and a diamond ring don't feel the same if a nigga ain't got his eyes closed (eyes closed)
I know you had a hard time baby, relax your mind
Shit, soon as Christ turned water into wine everything was fine

[Chorus]

[Ab-Soul]
Uh, I said it's a celebration, clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp with a glass of moscato
What up hoe? What up?
I said, what up hoe? What up?
Uh, I said it's a celebration, clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp with a glass of moscato
What up hoe? What up?
I said, what up hoe? What up? Alright

Uh, yeah, sip slow

But don't nobody rhyme like this no more
Call me the 2010 Rakim
I got soul, there's more in store
Feel like a CVS, open 24
Spent nights tryin' to overshadow my shadow
For niggas tryin' to block my light like a solar eclipse
I bring a knife to a fist fight and when I cut a record
So when I cut the cheese, shit you know what it is
Mr. Absoulutely the most incredible at this
So adjust your bass, your treble and then

[Chorus]
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some
[x2]

Finna break this blunt down and burn me up one
Then sip on this Remy 'til it turn me up some
For me it's more difficult to be simple than it is to be complex
As a lot of apartments
You niggas comedy, I'm laughing at you probably
We are not the same, there's no strand of monotony
Between you and I until we die
Revelations say you either fry or fly
And it's hard to find God when you ain't never seen Him
It's pie in the sky and there's bodies on the cement
And I know you lookin' at me like, "You don't speak English"
I bring the heat like a phoenix, a son under Phoenix sun
And I'm rootin' for the Lakers when they play the Phoenix Suns
I ain't really into sports, that's just where I'm from
Long Term Two
And if it's in your possession then follow the directions my dude

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Come come now
Pac told me fuck the world, I'm 'bout to cum now
I've been a pro, but now I'm profound
Propane on posers, restraining from the doja
Imagine if I smoke, I probably come up with a quote
So heavy you'll forget every album you heard from Hova
Or 2pacalypse I'm Hub City's novelist
Come and get your scholarship, I'm taking kids to school
A pool full of spit, dive in, I'm 'bout to drool
You'll drown trynna backstroke on concepts that I wrote
I was a black sheep, but now I'm just a goat
And I'm 'bout to elope, married to the game joe
This is hip hop at its finest, where'd you find this? In a Ziploc
Til the wheels fall off, fuck a pit-stop or what not
Where my tear drop? I murdered it
My pot-holes is turbulence
I'm in the sky wit it
When you listening to Kendrick, just

[Chorus]

This for my niggas that really rap all night
No sleep, do it with your eyes closed
I can see your vision from Del-Amo
Poppa took the television, but left the radio
Ill niggas, wack niggas, what's the ratio?
Is this shit degrading or inspirational?
I'll have you know I must've wrote about a thousand rhymes, a thousand times
I give you my word

[Kendrick Lamar]
Cause I just gotta be heard
I just gotta be heard
I just gotta be heard
Said I gotta be, yes sir I gotta be
Heard, heard, heard, heard

[Chorus]

--- Watch Yo Lady ---
Artist: Ab-Soul f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Long Term (Mixtape)
Song:   Watch Yo Lady
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
I'm a soldier mane, thought I told ya mane
I aim and flame ya, I'm the pro-to-pane
Niggas sizing me up like I'm buying a tux
So I interrupt, crease 'em, iron 'em up
With the nina, not talking 'bout the two singers
Cause a leprechaun wouldn't even press his luck
I'm sure to pluck any chicken with a rhythm I could fuck
I tell 'em call me up
Like is it on or what, can I cut 'til dawn, or what?
A slut say she want a slice of all of us
Intelligent, say her marble's marvelous
She go down south like black colleges
I'm a psychologist, I tell her I can adjust
Anything in the world that be bothering her
Everywhere I go, guarantee she go
Pussy pop on the low like a silencer

[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then I'm back at the dealership
Diamonds on my necklace, diamonds on my left wrist
Diamonds on my right wrist, damnit I'm the brightest
Back to the realest shit
You an exclamation, fuck an explanation

[Chorus: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Better watch yo lady!
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
Better watch yo lady!

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Back to the realist shit, niggas ain't raw
You grilling, I'mma menage a woman and I
Barrage, be intimate, a massage beginning with
Caress from her tongue, deep throat raw
Lot's of trauma, ya baby momma
Brain is crazy: Jeffrey Dahmer
And I'm finna shoot like a dirty llama
Big truck kicking up dust: conquer
Chocolate seats: Willy Wonka
Passenger: Pretty Woman
Directed back, bring ya compass
You bringing Carson, you bringing Compton
Y'all bring the nonsense, we bring the real
Like pro tools, never gross 500 mil
And we out in Brazil, in the green like Blankas
Bonkers, tell 'em Top Dawg is here!

[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then I'm back at the dealership
Diamonds on my necklace, diamonds on my left wrist
Diamonds on my right wrist, damnit I'm the brightest
Back to the realest shit
You an exclamation, fuck an explanation

[Chorus: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Better watch yo lady!
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
Better watch yo lady!

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
I think it's that give us that back
Whatever war you bring, send me to Iraq
I rap like my tongue was sitting on a match
You struck by lightning, frightening, gotta be a Heisman
Trophy, lowkey, the one and only
Slay a ho, play a ho like an oldie
Yup, and I'm dope like Opi
Um, so I'm out when the police
Come, like a nut, I'm a nut
For the bucks like a shotgun bust, and I bust
Venom inside the brains of young dames
Like Mr. Dash speaking to his kids on Jay-Z
We running the game
Y'all slipping like run in the rain
Ya bitches running away from y'all to us
In God we trust, at y'all we bust

[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then I'm back at the dealership
Diamonds on my necklace, diamonds on my left wrist
Diamonds on my right wrist, damnit I'm the brightest
Back to the realest shit
You an exclamation, fuck an explanation

[Chorus: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Better watch yo lady!
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
Better watch yo lady!

Artist: Alicia Keys f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack
Song:   It's On Again
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Kendrick Lamar]
And everybody know the story of David and Goliath but this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recordin' this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley of peace, with bare FEET (whoa)
Run through the flames, that's more passion for ME (whoa)
I passed that, this morning just so the world can SEE (whoa)
Got them wolves on me, no watch me lick 'em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by her, what

[Alicia Keys]
I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm tryin' to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know

[Interlude: Alicia Keys]
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off - unless you move forward

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I bet they wonder hoooooow, I go on, go on
I bet they wonder hoooooow, I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again" - whoa-ohhh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again - whoa-ohhh

[Alicia Keys]
I am a lonely hero, tryin' to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Alicia Keys]
Say the work don't stop, cause they don't stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the 'burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto

[Chorus] - minus first four words</pre>

Album:  Oxnard
Song:   Tints
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Anderson .Paak]
I been feelin' kinda cooped up, cooped up
Iâm tryna get some fresh air
Hey why you got the roof off, roof off?
You know it never rains here
And you ain't gotta flash who you took in your picture
You ain't gotta draw on the waist of attention
Paparazzi wanna shoot ya, shoot ya
Niggas dyinâ for less out here

I been in my bag anyway
Tryna throw a bag in the safe
Giggin', tourin', tryna ride the bass
Wavin' my lil' ones and bathing apes
Niggas crying for less out here
Do what I gotta do bruh, do bruh
Get up in my rearview mirror

I can't be ridin', ridin', round that open strip
I need tints, I need tints
(Windows tinted, I need my windows tinted)
I canât be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints, I need tints
(Windows tinted, I need my windows tinted)
And itâs no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints, I need tints
(Windows tinted, I need my windows tinted)
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints, I need tints
(Windows tinted, I need my windows tinted)

[Kendrick Lamar]
You probably think a nigga trollinâ
Or showin' out for the cameras
Fuck I'm doin' fish-bowlinâ?
One hunnid thou on the passenger
Bitch, I'm Kendrick Lamar, respect me from afar
I was made in his image, you call me a god
Everybody in attendance, I'm about to perform
Everybody get offended by the shit I got on
Like, can you buy that, nigga?
Nine hunnid horse, can you drive that, nigga?
A G5, can you fly that, nigga?
I need tints so I can look at the snakes and posers
I need tint 'cause bomb head is non-disclosure
I need tint so I can live with a peace of mind
Without niggas takin' a piece of mine
And peace be still and not do fines
Fuck a fix-it ticket, you pull me over you might see
One of your bitches

[Anderson .Paak]
I can't be ridin', ridin', round that open strip
I need tints, I need tints
(Windows tinted, I need my windows tinted)
I can't be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints, I need tints
(Windows tinted, I need my windows tinted)
And it's no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints, I need tints
(Windows tinted, I need my windows tinted)
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints, I need tints
(Windows tinted, I need my windows tinted)

You know I like it presidential
Stretch it out, that's a limo
Pull it over let me get behind ya
Where we goin' they don't need to know
Ghost ridin' in the Phantom
Niggas never see me comin'
She wanna hold me like a ransom
(Bitch, I don't know you)
But the money keep me runnin'

I been in my bag anyway
Tryna throw a bag in the safe
Giggin', tourin', tryna ride the bass
Wavin' my lil' ones and bathing apes
Niggas crying for less out here
Do what I gotta do bruh, do bruh
Get up in my rearview mirror

I can't be ridin', ridin', round that open strip
I need tints, I need tints
(Windows tinted, I need my windows tinted)
I can't be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints, I need tints
(Windows tinted, I need my windows tinted)
And it's no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints, I need tints
(Windows tinted, I need my windows tinted)
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints, I need tints
(Windows tinted, I need my windows tinted)

[Anderson .Paak & Tayla Parx]
I, I think I'm 'bout to black out
Can't see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
I got the goons up on the payroll
They won't see me coming
They won't see me coming no, no
I, I think I'm 'bout to black out
Can't see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
I got the goons up on the payroll
They won't see me coming
They won't see me coming</pre>

Artist: A$AP Rocky f/ Action Bronson, Big K.R.I.T, Danny Brown, Joey Bada$$, Kendrick Lamar, Yelawolf 
Album:  Long.Live.A$AP
Song:   1 Train
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[ASAP Rocky]
Uhh; feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready (BLAOW BLAOW BLAOW BLAOW)
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout, all the O's in my bank account (whaaat)
X the O's/hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (whaaat)
Ever since this new star fame came about
or, ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out (huh)
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
with a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like "DOO DOO!" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like "Mmm-mmm"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold; I rhyme cold
My K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K-9 drone
That ba-nana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP - I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'nance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
but my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
or that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
that they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again,
You in school at 10 - LATE; "Radioactive's" goin' gold
and so - GREAT; do I give a flyin' duck?
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a flyin' duck~!
Nothin' but a buckshot (CH-POW!)
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this, cold, since 2Pac was froze
and thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

[Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin (hell no)
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis (naw)
Bitch when I say this I mean this (mean this) "Ho, I'm the meanest" (meanest)
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit - STOP IT! YOU NOT THIS!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860 (skrrt)
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moons reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth (uhh)
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse (uhh)
Red roses dropped from boxes very often (uhh)
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton (uhh)
Outstandin'; I fixed the game 
between Georgia Southern and Grambling; you see us scramblin'
sellin' Susan Sarandon (Sarandon); the cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state (state)
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake (please)
Cuffed to my wrist Ive got the briefcase (money)
The gavel slam, Im a free man, try not to eat ham, yeah

[Big K.R.I.T]
Big KRIT, shawty..
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I cant pronounce, like, How you ask for that?
"Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?"
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack; all I wanted was love
and all they had was dap; fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win 
is the aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, Ive been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, Im taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a, killer, 86er, nigga, thats my born year
Get the fuck from round here, thats just my country ways
Suckin' on your mommas titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin grain, fuckin hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter {I'LL TAKE THAT SHIT UP WITH MY BASS}
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they wont have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why cant you?
In order to come up close, youll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too (that wasn't no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' Benji tags on your wifeys ass (on yo wifey's ass!)
Thats out of line, but +In Living Color+..
Im more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers - a true artist</pre>

Song:  Fuckin' Problems
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: 2 Chainz] + (A$AP & Drake) + {Drake} + {{KL}}
I love bad bitches, dat my fuckin problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, dat my fuckin problem
And yeah I like to fuck I got a fuckin problem
(I love bad bitches, dat my fuckin problem)
(And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem)
{If findin somebody real is your fuckin problem}
{{Bring your girls to the crib maybe we can solve it}}

[A$AP Rocky]
Hold up; bitches simmer down (UGH)
Takin hella long bitch, give it to me now (UGH)
Make that thing pop, like a semi or a nine
"Ooh baby like it raw" with the +Shimmy Shimmy Ya+ ha?
A$AP (YEAH) get like me (UGH)
Never met a motherfucker fresh like me (YEAH)
All these motherfuckers wanna dress like me (UGH)
Put that chrome to your dome make you +Sweat+ like +Keith+
Cause I'm the nigga, the nigga nigga, like how you figure?
Gettin figures, and fuckin bitches, she rollin Swishers
Brought her bitches, I brought my niggaz, they getting bent up
off the liquor, she love my liquorice, I let her lick it
(ALRIGHT) They say money make a nigga act niggarish (UGH)
But least a nigga nigga-rich!!
I be fuckin broads like I be fuckin bored
Turn a dyke bitch out have her fuckin boys
Beast

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Hoe I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggaz you've been leadin on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin on
Got a feelin that's the same dudes that we speakin on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin read-along
Ain't a fuckin sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then just... (okay, okay, okay)
Then just, drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put The Beatles on
All that shit you talkin 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin from a nigga I don't know then I don't trust it
If you comin for my head, then muh'fucker get to bustin
Yes Lorrrrrd! I don't really say this often
But this long dick nigga ain't for the long talkin
I beast

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah hoe, this the finale
My pep talk turned into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the Valley
Now vacay'd in Atlanta then she goin back to Cali
Mm~! Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein me like a nigga don't exist
Girl! I know you want this dick!
Girl! I'm Kendrick Lamar
A/K/A Benz is to me just a car
That mean your friends need to be up to par
See my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mm, kill 'em all dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved listen what the crystal ball say
Halle, Berry, halle-lujah
Holla, back, I'll, do ya
Beast

Artist: Big Sean f/ Kendrick Lamar, Royce Da 5'9"
Album:  Detroit
Song:   100
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggaz right
And my family live that life
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night
As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 100 things to do before I die

[Big Sean]
Couple niggaz on the hitlist and bitches on a different type
Same shit different nights, till I live a different life
Sean you looking tired, damn homie that's all
I've been stressin so hard I'm surprised I ain't going bald
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into ya'll, hatin'
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggaz wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
Niggaz sleepin with that mac and I ain't talkin bout computer love
All the wrong people you a price tag
Now you pray to God hoping that you got a Christ tag
Make it where I'm from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, say nay my son
Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there too

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If I just stop breathin, even though I got all this motherfuckin money
Won't keep my heart beatin
Just don't let me die
Wake me up
You can't catch me dreamin
Bout all of this motherfuckin money
Cocaine rush, I'm speedin
Cocaine rush...

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me
I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection at the same time
I'm accepting the fact that there'll never be nothing perfect about me
Shit, I'm just waiting on a win
Come up with better hooks, the hoes'll take it on the chin
We are 6 mile bred, thats why you see our sick style yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me
The baddest chick is yonking, imagine this chatty yapping at me
5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now I'm Cali swaggin'
My nigga listen, I'm over the fame
You number 1, I'm 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollin with lames, we ain't rollin the same
I'm the best out in this motherfucker
If I could get a check out of this motherfucka big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this motherfucka, with no regrets
If you ain't living your life for ya kids, I ain't giving yo ass no respect
(Sean, I love you my nigga, I'm out)

[Chorus] + [Bridge]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I gotta break ya fuckin heart
I gotta climb these fuckin charts (I gotta climb)
I gotta do something that's innovative
Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia's momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty of Carne Asada (I gotta)
I gotta find me a wife to elope (I gotta)
I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
But those who lied to the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like yall, but thats not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth
Need to know every detail about this Earth, the devil controls it
So before you scrutinise how I feel ask God if those polls important
The end is near!

[Chorus] + [Bridge]</pre>

Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Big Sean]
Hm-mm.. I look up (hmm)
Yeah and I take my time, nigga; I'mma take my time, whoa
Power moves only, nigga... {*laughs*}

Boy I'm 'bout my bid'ness on bid'ness, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women, yeah that's bunk bed bitches
I've done lived more than an eighty year old man still kickin'
Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
on some ground ball shit; cause now I run my city 
on some town hall shit; they prayin' on my motherfuckin' 
downfall bitch, like a drought, but
You gon' get this rain like it's Mayweather, G.O.O.D. Music, Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better; they told me I never boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
Pshh, but fuck tryin' and not doin'
Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G. and Pac bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that Juicy vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is Mayday at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like AK was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than err'body that's better than err'body
Rep Detroit, err'body, Detroit versus err'body
I'm so fuckin' first class, I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop, drop fire
and not because I'm name dropping, "Hall of Fame" droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OG's
Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect more G's, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week, Sean Don

[Kendrick Lamar]
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
(I don't smoke crack, motherfucker I sell it!)
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fucking pill, I'mma a pop you and give you this

Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up and bomb on they mom while she watching the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast, one hand, I juggle them both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs
Fuck y'all pictures, your Instagram can gobble these nuts
Gobble dick up til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch 
{West West West, West West West}
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies'll prolly turn these niggas to fucking Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich ass white girls looking for parties
Playing with Barbies, wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgment to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
(I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it)
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aiming straight for your pelvis, you can't stomach me
You plan on stumpin' me? Bitch Ive been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas, climbin' 100 mil' in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
Bout who's the best MC? Kendrick, Jigga and Nas
Eminem, Andre 3000, the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rocking no more designer shit
White Ts and Nike Cortez, this red Corvettes anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big KRIT, Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all but I'm tryna MURDER you niggas
Trying to make sure your core fans never HEARD of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or VERB from you niggas
What is competition? I'm trying to raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off trying to skydive
Out the exit window of 5 G5s with 5 grand
With your granddad as the pilot he drunk as fuck trying land
With the hand full of arthritis and popping prosthetic leg
Bumpin Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast...

[Jay Electronica]
You could check my name on the books
I Earth, Wind, and Fired the verse, then rained on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders and keep a tin of beans 
for when the weather turns the coldest; the Lord is our shepherd
so our cup runneth over; put your trust in the Lord 
but tether your Chevy Nova; Im spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians thats fidgeting with the cobra
Im silent as a rock, cause I came from a rock
Thats why I came with the rock, then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
Cause I endured a lot of pain for everything that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rains from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight, passion of the Christ
Right, to baskin' in the limelight, it take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS mysteries
In a lofty place, tangling with Satan over history
You cant say shit to me - Alhamdulillah
Its strictly by faith that we made it this far</pre>

She got a {*censor*} tattoo and you ain't e'en know it (real talk)
We about to form a little group and you ain't e'en know it - let's get it
Stuck in a rock and a hard place; Eminem, Pac and where God stay
Timberlands pop that jaw bone, now bitch nigga, tell me how that tar taste
And even Tarzan can get swung on, I never hung out with the loud mouth
You got a foul mouth and that dead body gon' smell foul when it fouls out
She filed my nails in the Bahamas, we found ourselves in the Bahamas
She found God, meditation and peace, I found myself without a condom
You know everybody having them babies, it's a beautiful thing it ain't crazy
If a rapper monogamous, you know what the problem is? Too many bitches got rabies
And I hate a ho hoppin' woman, stank pussy-poppin' woman
You fuckin' fool don't know about you but my dick need 70 years on it
Anything after that is just a bonus and I been in the lab with my opponents
AND SINCE SWAY DONE SWAYED THAT LIST, HE GOT A FLAT SCREEN THE NEXT MORNING~!
Tell 'em I need my credit when it's due, tell 'em I need my lettuce when it's new
Tell 'em I got a fetish for fine fabric Franklins and saying "FUCK YOU~!"
Tell 'em it's TDE 'til I'm DDT'd in that grave and Top Dawg is proof
'til my nigga Whoo Kid get free, ain't shit comin' for free, I'm 'bout to rape you niggas 'til you recoup

[ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, yeah..
It's a groovy nigga, that's all day, Backwood hold, three grams (yeah)
Got a six-shooter, that revolver spinning, shell stuck inside, but won't jam (yeah)
This hoody here about two stacks, hell yeah that bitch could gon' go ham (yeah)
Molly in her drink, but she asked me to and oh yeah I got this on cam (uhh)
Gangsta nigga, no trap beats, bet I still sound like that new shit
Originality in my blueprint, still Figg side, Figuero pimp
Her big ass where my palm hit, pull my dick out, she gon' balm it
Swag surfin' all through the world, slide through the sea on a comet
+O-X-Y+ for these +Moron+s, that be that new shit I'm pushin'
Raise off of them pockets, uhh, bring more of them coffins
These niggas ain't poppin', uhh, tell them old niggas to move on
Aw damn I done said it, yeah, all them can beheaded

[Ab-Soul]
She ain't single but she solo, you ain't e'en know it (Soulo)
Unsigned with sold out shows, you ain't e'en know it (Soulo)
My lips black but they aint chapped, she aint even know that
Lets have sex, she said, "Yes", you know she aint "no" that
Seed of life on my chest, my head next to her breast
My mind all in the clouds, just bought an ounce of the best
No talking when Im off that loud, I came quick so she pissed
You know Im good for another round but its hard when everybody on your dick
Know real niggas thats Crips, I know real niggas thats Bloods
Know real niggas thats thuggin' like you aint know whats up
Got codeine in my cup, got a couple checks that need cashing
And you could take that to the bank, whats life without a balance?
You ain't even know it, nigga I be everywhere you aint even going; I thought it was snowing
but Im just the coldest nigga out here flowin', sick of all that bullshit yall been promoting, but
(SOUL) Carson in the motherfuckin' house
Del Amo, watch your motherfuckin' mouth
I took the game by storm, just to X men out
I'm crazy out my mind, I put my life on the line
The tortoise only makes progress when his neck sticks out
Just a little token of gold if you ain't know it, though

[Jay Rock]
Respect, I get the utmost, I'm so dope I'm a walking kilo (kilo)
36 Os (Os), you don't even know I'm gettin' cheese like Cheetos
You mad that we BMFing, bitch-ass niggas steady PMSing
I, never show my hands, can't know my plans, gotta keep them guessing
Rock, I was off the scene, now a nigga back like a four and a half
Shooting up the set like Spielberg, see the big picture when them hammers flash
I don't post a lot on Instagram: that's the quickest way they'll get you man
Leave that shit for the bitches man; Alphabet boys, they'll get your ass
IRS, they was on a nigga, cashed them out, not I'm scot-free (WHOO)
Got my passport in my JanSport, now I'm overseas, uh
You don't even know it, Rock been killin' this shit
No gloves, no mask on me, just 100 thousand cash on me, back then, I was doing bad, homie
All my bitches bad now, my gold hoes try to keep tabs on me
Safe to say I'm the man now, fuck ass nigga just stand down
'Fore the shots go up and it's man down, hands down, still poppin'
No prescription, I'm flexin', suplex a pussy, I've been off the edge
Too late to push me, nigga I ain't fell off, used to move Frosted Flakes like Kellogg's
Pull up to the bank, count paper like tellers, Top Dawg, Money Gang, bitch, we've been on
Clothesline the beat, nigga, John Cena; been having stripes, can't walk in my Adidas
Kicked in the door, hand on the Nina, Black Hippy shit, rock gon' bleed 'em

[Future]
I'm turned up er'ry day, you don't e'en know it
Gotcha bitch with me right now, you don't e'en know it
We turn up in the club, you don't e'en know it
Got a hunnid bottles comin, you don't e'en know it, ey
We came up from nothin, you don't even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you don't e'en know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don't e'en know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don't e'en know it

[Chorus/Outro: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don't e'en know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean, you don't e'en know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't e'en know it
I came up from bottom, you don't e'en know it
My niggaz all ride with me, you don't e'en know it
Got killas with me right now, you don't e'en know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't e'en know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't e'en know it

"This is the way I feel"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
A day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
Two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent cause he lost his job
A month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
Six months before that her mother said she won't see her father
And this before he did a year when them charges was brought up
I shook my head, turned around, then found a hundred dollars

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] *2X*
I don't know why he keep blessing me
I don't know why he keep blessing me
I don't know why he keep blessing me
I don't know why he keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why

[Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday I invaded privacy of a home
The day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
A week before I had loaded bullets inside that chrome
Two weeks before that I shot them bullets and he was gone
A month before that I cursed my mother then slammed the door
Six months before that I hit my woman, she hit the floor
I stormed out, then seen a black Honda Accord
Them hollow tips missed me, then hit that little boy

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] *2X*

[Kendrick Lamar]
So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling
Closed my eyes, then asked myself how I was feeling
I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
Is my life coincidental or just God willing?
I came to grips, jumped up, looked out the window
Seen my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
Bullets is nameless, I guess this was meant for
me to give him a hundred dollars then trash my pistol

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why

[Kendrick Lamar] + (BJ the Chicago Kid)
So I can bless you (you, you, you, you)
So I can bless you (you, you, you, you)
So I can bless you (you, you, you, you)
Yeah, you (you)

[BJ the Chicago Kid]
Lord help me, cause I need you
I know this weed is burning, and I'm on drink number two
But it's all to soothe the pain from this cold, cold world
Sometimes I think you can help me (help me)
But this bus here is temporary, so I'm talking to you
This sick world will drive a sane man crazy
(Dead birds dropping out the sky) daughters having their father's babies
And this the news I hear
when I got kids, nieces and nephews turn a year
I wonder, will it get better?
A little cheddar when it get better?
But the rest of that's cash
Make last year's Christmas gift be my bad

[Chorus 3: BJ the Chicago Kid] *2X*
But somehow you keep blessing me
But somehow you keep blessing me
But somehow you keep blessing me
But somehow you keep blessing me
But somehow, but somehow, but somehow

[BJ the Chicago Kid]
Ohhhhhh, yeahhhh
Somehow you keep blessing me
Ohhhh, yeah-yeah-yeah
If I just keep the faith, yeah-yeah
I know you'll be right there
Sometimes it may not seem that you are there
But you're there, I feel you're there, you're everywhere
And I thank you for protecting me in these streets
from danger seen and unseen
I never know what happened the night I wasn't there
Something told me leave, so I left
It was the next morning, three got shot after the club
All listening to that small voice, oh you saved my life</pre>

[Intro]
"Kids is what make me feel so good
 See you looking at the glory that's coming up into the future of life
 See the younger youth is what's gonna make everything to keep going
 after I done passed down the hill"

"Young and black"

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Don't you know, that's it's true
that for me, and for you
the world is a ghetto
Don't you know, don't you know, that's it's true
that for me, and for you
the world is a ghetto

[Interlude]
"Then there's a lot of funky things, in this country
 and there's good things too
 But our rights are more funky than you good
 Shit ain't getting better!"

"We've changed some for the best
 An awful lot of cases for the worst
 and some have not changed at all"

[BJ the Chicago Kid]
Walking down the street, foggy-eyed
Looking at the sky, starry-eyed
Searching for a place, weary eyes
Crying in the night, yeah, yeah, teary-eyed

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
"Dude, we got to get our minds together"

"Any time a brother was shot by another brother in his own neighborhood
 then go to his funeral and turn over his own casket, they need to have the police down there
 Cause see, the niggas is N.A.A.C.P. and
 Niggas ain't acting like colored people"

"If I can't work and make it, I steal and take it"

"(sample incomprehensible) ...if a nigga can put air in a bottle and sell it, he'll do it man
 A nigga can sell anything, I ain't gon' lie"

[Kendrick Lamar]
As I watched the sky change colors
the rain flooded the neighborhoods of the black brothers
The black mothers are stressing, the coroners have covered
Another statistic, episodes of a cold summer
The street runners got the same legs as Michael Johnson
The fast life surpassed life beyond the conscience
Profanity in the air, the children use the content
The vanity's in the air, that Louis bag haunted
That black girl with the hair that's kind of coarse
Her baby daddy's in court, she smoking on a Newport
Seventeen with dreams of becoming a stripper
or becoming an AIDS victim while touching them zippers
The life that we living in, things we would do just to live again
How can an angel forever live in sin?

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro]
"You know, well anybody that uses somebody else to gain is pimping"

"Okay, well I'ma tell you what soul brother, lookie here
 Can't nobody pimp you but your pimp-ass self, you understand?"

"Then there's a lot of funky things, in this country
 and there's good things too
 But our rights are more funky than you good
 Shit ain't getting better!"

"We've changed some for the best
 An awful lot of cases for the worst
 and some have not changed at all"</pre>

Song:   Ballin
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this

[Verse 1]
Okay, headed to that swap meat
Coppin all that Avalon
Fresh white T's and some J's what I had in mind
I remember days when a nigga didn't have a dime
Now I got big dollas, I just buy whatever come to mind
Choppas squeezed, I remember when I used to window shop
Now I hit the mall, buy it all 'cus I'm on the top
Boss like I used to dream of this moment
Used to roll that stress, now I roll that kill, I call it coma
Step inside my ride, I know you smell the aroma
6-50 top back, chillin on my corner
Used to be MacDonald's, now we eat at Benihana's
5 star suites with freaks, that's on my mama
They tell me money evil but it wash away my problems
Don't matter what the price, lil mama just know I got it
Aw, it ain't trickin if you got it
My bank account solid and my wallet need a diet

[Bridge]
I used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin

[Chorus]
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this

[Verse 2]
Like my nigga meet me outside
These homies rush me just so they can steal my flashdrive
My music that important, imported in iPod
Buying my CDs like payin ties, act God
I'm sure success will taste better than nectarines
Growing in the spring, basket's the fruit of life
Had the boy arrange me every time I pick up the mike
I hop my entertainment be a bigga impact than Mike
Can I live like the princess of Munda?
Got a princess to groom the lacks o my scalp with a golden comb
And I'm on, Cloud 9, stopping acts like in the sky
I'm from Compton, can't you hear me coming like I'm from the shy
I'm inspired from a magic twice, which art is a rep and run?
But if they knew my intentions the reff and probably run
I'm just a good kid from the city who made straight A's
Tryna make the transition from Rose to Kool Aid

[Bridge]
I used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin

[Chorus]
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this

[Verse 3]
Okay, started as a youngin, now I'm at the top
Used to ride the city bus, now I'm at the car lot
And we live up in the mall now, something like a regular
I ball every day like clap, I got my cheddar up
I used to smoke dirt weed, now I'm smoking better
But in school I couldn't get a girl but now I'm getting groupie love
Now I'm seeing better days, mama's so proud of me
Do it for my grandma but I know she lookin down on me
Reach in my pocket and grab big bills
If this is Caribbean rich I like how this feel
Hah, and ain't nobody help me get here
If you lookin for me at the top is where I'll be, I'll be there go

[Bridge]
I used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin

[Chorus]
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this</pre>

Artist: Buddy f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Idle Time
Song:   Staircases
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus 2X: Buddy]
Staircases take me high
Escalators take me high
Ladders take me high
Elevators take me high

[Buddy]
Uh, yeah, yo, started at the surface and my goal is up
cause once you stay down, then you gon' get stuck
And I'm just tryna climb and grind at the same time
Dangling off rooftops is what I call hang time
Walking through the hall, counting my flaws
My ego got caught in an elevator wall
Got it out, raised it to the rooftop, damn
Got to take the ladder cause the escalator jammed
Made it to the top, but I ain't even stopping
I said a prayer and a wish, and turned my skateboard to a rocket
I'm gone to the skies, I'm nothing more than another rebel
But I'm still tryna take it to another level
Get up out the ghetto, maybe hop up on a shuttle
Eating jello with a piece of metal, my foot on the pedal
If people say the world could fit into a little pebble
Then give me one good reason why you think we should settle
Let's get it off

[Chorus 2X]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside my eyes, you can see the universe fly
Deep inside my pupils, the alien's camouflaged
Another way to shoot you, my mind is of mass destruction
I drop a gallon of Henny in the Big Dipper, then dive
Bitches skinny dipping in my orbit
Ever seen a Martian gorgeous, or some UFO Porsches?
I live inside the air, plus I wear Air Jordans
So the mic/Mike is always near me whether swagging or recording
Journey on my voyage, you know that sky is the limit
But it's ironic, that method never applied to Kendrick
I catapult over your telescope, and when I'm finished
I grab the fire that's burning from Mars to light an incense
This rapping's just a metaphor, and I deserve a medal for
writing another metaphor, about ambition
I envision me taking off, astronauting myself
Fuck the world, I'll beat that bitch with the Orion's belt
That's high

[Chorus 2X]

[Buddy]
As I'm floating all alone, I look up and I start thinking
In a moment I'll be gone, getting high so I'm not sinking
As I'm floating all alone, I look up and I start thinking
In a moment I'll be gone, getting high so I'm not sinking
Yeah, yeah,yeah
Getting high so I'm not sinking, yeah

[Chorus 2X]</pre>

Artist: J. Cole f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Born Sinner
Song:   Forbidden Fruit
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro: J. Cole] + (Kendrick)
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice fallin from her lips
Took a little sip (boom) little sip
Took a little sip, took a little sip
Took-took a little, took a little, took a little sip, uh
Uh-huh

[J. Cole]
Aiyyo I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggaz hold tec's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe, that Eve had Adam in check?
And if so, you gotta expect
to sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get LOOSE
Huh, Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the old testament
Niggaz pay for head but the pussy's sold separate
Same bitch givin brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee "The Finisher"
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words, don't hate me son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it cain't be done
Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (J. Cole)
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip - oh no
Apple juice fallin from her lips
Took a little sip - boom
Bitches, come and, go (you know that)
Money, come and, go (you know that)
Love, come and, go (don't shit last)
Bitches, come and, go (you know that)
Money, come and, go (you know that)
Love, come and, go (don't shit last)

[J. Cole]
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called, gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a Maroon 5, no Adam Le-vine
Came a man by myself, only Father was Time
I know that she relate, baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she's swallowin mine
And that's why you all in my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Ma$e was a reverend
I was a young nigga makin A's at 11
or 12, tryin to get a taste of the heaven
or hell; only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her momma home, "Baby don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
just to get the cover of the double-X-L
or Fader; FUCK ya magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talkin 'bout later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the +Boy's+ a +Man+ now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect
I praise legends but this what's next
The boy's sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and the pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of, death
Blaow~!

[Chorus]

[Outro: J. Cole]
Don't shit last, and you know that
Went to hell got hot didn't melt
Only man above me is God himself
All these other niggaz is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali and Jarobi
What up Queens? Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a +Dollar and a Dream+ and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
Bitch, biatch! That should be my new ad lib
Biatch! I got a new one
I finally got a cool ad lib
Like some cool shh like biatch!
Be at all the shows everybody be like, biatch!
Biatch! Biatch!
Or you can do the low cool shit, bitch~!</pre>

Artist: Cozz f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Effected
Song:   Hustla's Story
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Cozz]
Woo! Yeah, ayy
Shoutout my hustlers
I mean, everybody hustle
They ain't gotta be no motherfuckin' trapper
Just hustlers, you feel me?
Look, look

[Cozz]
I said, wake up, open up shop, get yo hustle on
Sellin' pills straight out her crib, and break into another home
Tryna get in and out, get his double double on
This ain't my story that I'm singin' my nigga, but this is another song
This prob'ly your uncle song, prob'ly your big brother song, your father or your mother song
I understand your circumstance so in your head there's nothin' wrong
How you could blame how we behave, if we paid and we ain't gettin' loans?
You don't know what's goin' on
If you ain't live to see this shit I can't describe
Takin' chances so they survive, this all happens just to take a life
In the end it was all for bread, and use the heat just to make it rise
Not sure how to raise a daughter, but they know to raise the price
So what you goin' through? Tell a nigga what you goin' through
I could probably relate, I could probably be late, and still be on time for you
I could probably spit mind for you, if you don't wanna tell your story
It's the same as yours, I hustle early in the morning
Wake up, open up shop, get your hustle on
Sellin' pills straight out her crib, and break into another home
I understand your circumstance so in their heads, there's nothin' wrong
But they don't know what's goin' on, they don't know what's goin' on

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Cozz)
Wake up (wake up, woo!) I know only
Trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
If I can't lay up in the streets, I feel lonely
If I gotta break up with the streets, I feel lonely

[Cozz]
Look, yeah you got your car, yeah you got your gold
Your money don't fold but your momma still at home
Fam don't want your dirty money, you look clean but your mother sad
Your girl felt neglected, now your daughter got another dad
Local block hustler, my father was a customer
Moms used to watch him buy his weed then she would cuss at him
Only for the weed, he felt free from that subtle bust
Moved back and it was primetime, and now I'm on my prime time
But hustler turned pimp though, he was gettin' pimped dough
Now only sellin' his dope, but now he sellin' nymphos
Not so cautious about how he sells, made his way to county jails
Now he lonely in them cells, how he feel?
It was probably hell, he got out but on that same shit
I guess when you lawyer to yourself then you can't switch
But how can you blame kid? Don't know what he was goin' through
Cause hustle is his bread and butter, he don't want no other fool
But I wake up, open up shop, get my hustle on
Wake up early in the morn'
Make a couple records, gettin' reckless on these records 'til these fuck niggas respect it
Go and get it, make a difference, wake up with a new perspective motherfucker

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Justify the love of mine for life of crime, my life and times is hard at times
I fall at time like all the time and then I dream for baller time and then the clock rewind
And I - wake up! I know homie
I know homie

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Cozz] + (Kendrick Lamar)
We ain't chose this type of livin', it's what we gotta do
Part of niggas hear us Crippin' and drop out of school
Sellin' drugs or they pimpin' like some prostitutes
Livin' in a nightmare, pinchin' is what you gotta do
(Wake up)</pre>

Artist: Danny Brown f/ Ab-Soul, Earl Sweatshirt, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Atrocity Exhibition 
Song:   Really Doe
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Danny Brown]
Check~!
You niggas don't even know, all that talk then no show
Cannot tell me nothin', show me somethin' I ain't seen before
That hoe want my piccolo, smokin' on that mistletoe
Make her kiss all on it while we chop chop on them 24s
She look like a centerfold, mouth all on my genitals
Suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals
I be on them chemicals, she be on my testicles
Poked her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules
Rollin' up them vegetables, rappin' with that special flow
Only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4
I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show
Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe
Now I sell out all my shows, used to sell out all my blow
That was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll up 4
Now a nigga livin' good, I done made it out the hood
Think I'm goin' back? I wish a motherfucker would

[Chorus 2X: Kendrick Lamar]
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie
Whoa, really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe

[Ab-Soul]
Check, suh! Ayy, yeah

Still wicked as Aleister, Crowley, niggas know me well
For heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell
When you're gettin' money nigga, every day is sunny
I'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail
Second grade, took my momma weddin' ring, took that bitch to show and tell
Now I'm married to the game to no avail
Grounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck
Employer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer
With ambitions of a rider and half, the shit on my rider I don't even want
The Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah!)
Givenchy bikers with the rev rips
Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick (chyeah!)
Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips
Soulo Hoe the prophecies, +Atrocities, Exhibition+ (chyeah!)
Oh yeah, now a nigga livin' good
But good could be better, I wish a motherfucker would
... Soul~!

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya
Life to end in vain before the end is near, see I can hear ya
cryin' silent sittin' in the dark, holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
Sin is such a work of art, watch out for the love lost
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand, things a nigga do for thousands
Made a million countin' sheep, gave it all to public housin'
Takin' off to Abu Dhabi, beamin' up the motor, Scotty
Talkin' to promoters, Scotty, everybody know it's Gotti
Murder one, you've heard of them, the revenant, the all day madness
Got it off the white but off the evidence, the blood on mattress
Big power, big stages, my zoo cannot fit the cages
This booth is not used to fakin', my crew just love confrontation
I chewed the face off the laces, I moved the weight from the waitress
I chef the pot that made poison, I cooked then kicked all the patients
My bitch is way beyond basic, that's, life insurance, car insurance
Good, pussy insurance, ayy, look what we're endurin'
Ayy, ridin' in foreigns, ayy, K-Dot, four years
I got the same watch but it's the real watch and that bitch fire
Speed Racer waitin' outside, the roof on it like a tank top
Countin' money, watchin' paint dry, when I'm done is when the rain stops, uhh

[Chorus]

[Earl Sweatshirt]
Good, hood
I wish a motherfucker, listen

Wish a motherfucker would, Brown
I had to put my foot down
It's like I'm poppin' a clutch, your hate palpable, your jaw full of dust
You gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?
And I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an +honor+ to judge
You a mouse that the falcon picked up
So disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month
I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck
And I never pass my momma no blunt, and kept my hair straight
Listen deadweight, never been a problem to dump
Look I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough
I keep it dirty as a spliff, my uncle Alchemist puff
I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club
I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must
It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs
Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks
Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts
You've been that same motherfucker since 2001
Well it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump
I'm at your house like, "Why you got your couch on my Chucks?"
Motherfucker (fucker, fucker, fucker...)</pre>

Artist: Dido f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Girl Who Got Away
Song:   Let Us Move On
Typed by: E-Squared

Don't wrap it up and go or hide it behind the sun
Just give it to me as it is
And let it stand
Don't fly it like a kite... between the clouds
It needs no excuse, just bring it down

Let us that are in pain look upon it
In all it's glory
Let us move on, Let us move on
This is short and it will pass
Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short, and it will pass

Every voice that is lifted
River and some pain
Show us now, and let love not be chained
We should feel what we can stand, let us be alive
Show enough, and we've done, now we can

Let us that are frozen get to see
In all it's glory
Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short and it will pass
Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short, and it will pass

And let all that is lost be forgotten
And it will pass
So let all that is lost be forgotten
Let us move on

[Kendrick Lamar]
Like the waters in the open sea
When tribulation come over you say yes hopefully
And yesterday you could probably say there's no hope for me
But today I'm overly dedicated
I'm posed to be testimony for broken hearts in the city
You're either crash landing or planning on flyin' with me
Misery love standing behind his company,
Well, vividly I could see that your feelings would like to dwell
On our past encounters, reaching over the counter
Told me that it's appealing to pop a pill less or down now
I heard emotions burn deep
I heard when you fall out of love, the drop is steep
I heard when you see a dove that's what you try to be
Got these burdens under my wings but I'm still free
Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray, I looked you in the eye and say

Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short and it will pass
Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short, and it will pass

Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short and it will pass
Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short, and in the past
And in the past</pre>

Artist: DJ Khaled f/ Ace Hood, Birdman, Kendrick Lamar, Mack Maine
Album:  Kiss the Ring *
Song:   B-Boyz
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

* iTunes bonus track; originally appeared on the Birdman & Mack Maine mixtape "Billionaire Minds"

[DJ Khaled]
Yeah, it's We the Best
It's Y.M.C.M.B.
One time for Top Dawg Entertainment

[Kendrick Lamar]
Talk about it, make 'em talk about it
Life to me is currency, prosperity, I got it
And your life to me is lifeless like it's living on life support
I license everything in my wallet, lightest boy with the biggest heart
Nigga play your part, or parallel park your ego next to me and violence
Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I must have won that from anybody who had it, or better yet forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac with a MAC in the back of a 'Lac
with a latch on the back of the trunk
Hit a punk in the back with a pump in the back till he's off balance
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future where you are mentioning talent
And I'm back in the back of the block where the cop wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block G, watch with a Glock or whatever hand-cut, no cup, more guns, more guts
Fuck boy, you fucked up twice, you fucked considering you drowning
Die in a lake with a date with a catfish, backflip, headfirst, smiling
Cry in the face of Jesus, we just pray we keep on styling
on you bitches, T.D.E., Y.M.C.M.B. bidness bitch

[Ace Hood]
Ace Hood
Birdman, what they do big dog?
Mack Maine, what's cracking folk?
Big money

Okay, nigga riding in a Maybie, and I'm probably with Baby
Don't talk nigga, fuck you, pay me, intercept your bitch like Bailey
Okay, big money on this side, hundred grand for the whip my bitch drive
Need a new safe, money getting too high, dead presidents all in my Levi's
Boy I swear this nigga be swagging, and I'm living lavish
Might cop me an Aston, Martin on 'em
Anything I drive, I own 'em, bad bitch and that ass ain't normal
Gotta put that pound game on her, beat it up, she deep in a coma
I'm super paid, two shows a day
My Rollie gold, no time to waste
What it do Berg? My fucking brother
Keep that pistol by me like my lovely momma
Hot as the summer, cold as the winter
Stay on them charts, I heard that they plotting my timber
Young nigga, got a lot of flows
Any nigga don't believe me? I make it look easy, easy, out of control

[Birdman]
Just like that boy
Death forbids honor, you understand me?
Dedication, respect, fully-loaded, yeah

Box full of choppers, hand on the trigger
Uptown gangster, get it how we get it
3rd Ward soldier, suicide rider
Militant minded, hundred mill on the counter
Hand Persian rug nigga, flame on the Bugatti
Christian Louboutin, Chanel for my models
Higher than Bugatti nigga, fishing on the fish scales
Nose diving for them hundreds, strapped up making mail
Fr-fresher than I've been before
Higher than we ever been, shining on them twenty-fours
Junior doing time hoe
On the grind hoe, while he doing time hoe

[Mack Maine]
Ya know, that time is money, and money still was made baby
Eight months ain't stop nothing nigga
It's like jail was third base, and my lil' nigga still came home, ya understand?

Yeah, I'm from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers
That's why when the babies grow up, damn they be like us
I came a long ways from rhyming up in crazy ciphers
Man I'm so happy my lil' brother came home from Rikers
Shout out to B.P., Thugga, Flow and Fayle, boy
My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy
My heart numb, ain't no pain I can't withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy, like a kickstand (Young Money)
Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil' nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick, damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
to cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force
Stand up niggas, what the fuck you brought them chairs for?
I went from making money from people with crack habits
to thanking God I'm in a whole 'nother tax bracket, amen

Album:  Major Key
Song:   Holy Key
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

{"This is, this is..."}

[Intro: Big Sean] + (DJ Khaled)
Whoa whoa whoa
Doin' what I gotta do, uh-huh
Whattup doe? (We the Best Music)
I guess I'm on my don shit
What that mean? I'ma go
Uh-huh (DJ Khaled!) Straight up

[Big Sean]
Late nights mixed with early days (uh-huh)
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates (straight up)
Stress weighin' on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showin' fake love when I prefer the hate man
Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it (respect)
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested (damn)
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never goin' south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skiis, preachin' what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eatin'
If it add a couple years to our life then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'ma take it just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch
Lately I been livin', life in detachment
I practice, seven spiritual laws and, cut off distractions
We been, all in the Hollywood Hills and, never been actin'
Detroit, gave me an accent and Christ, gave me his passion
Father help us, police doin' target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets cryin', standin' over a still body (God why?)
Niggas over stressin', we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist (nah)
Beat your ass until you purple, they can't even tell what your race is (damn)
Dr. King meet Dr. Dre except this doctor lost all his patience (damn)
Have you tied up in a basement with you and your partner facin' adjacent
until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlocked my spirit with the holy key
(The holy key, the holy key, the holy key, the holy key...)

[Chorus 2X: Betty Wright] + (DJ Khaled)
And I'ma celebrate it for a looong time
The drama couldn't break me now it's allll mine
Surrounded by my angels and we allll shine
Holy, holy, holy (holy key)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh-huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's comin' back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth", that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walkin' zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-buildin' this Rubix cube
So what you look up to? Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches, sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joinin' forces with sorcerers signin' me
Law enforcement, their forces tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment, my joy is to see all you bleed
Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need?
Crab and oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison, the point is the reason you won't die in peace
Open door for my boy now they eatin', we say finally
I destroy and divorce what you eatin', don't you hire me
Tape recordin' my voices and tweak it, let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evenin', you should try at least
I'm restorin' the portrait of feastin' nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been lookin' for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix

[Betty Wright]
Ohhhhhh-ohh-whoooa yeah
Mm, yeeeeah

[Chorus]

[Outro: Betty Wright]
Hooooly! Holy key!
Hoooooly~!!</pre>

Artist: DJ Khaled f/ Big K.R.I.T., J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Kiss the Ring
Song:   They Ready
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ FLash

[Intro]
DJ KHALED!

[J. Cole]
And you know it don't stop, grindin 'round that clock
Mastermindin my second album my first album just dropped
Scored a touchdown on my first down niggaz thought I was gon' flop
See I hustle like my momma but I look just like my pops
And we still duckin cops, ride around and take shots
Hennessy for my enemies, niggaz know I'm takin they spot
Cause that score up on the play clock, show just how I came from way back
Just like T-I-P told you +ASAP+ but you niggaz rappin like Aesop
Get a grip - oh that's your dream car? Nigga that's my old whip
Oh that's your dream girl? Nigga that's my old bitch
Oh that's your new flow? Nigga that's my old shit
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggaz

[Chorus: Cole]
One for the money, two for the show
Three for them hoes sayin anything goes
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever
I been around the world, twice to be exact
Six bad bitches and they lapped up in the back
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yo crew
Shorty look what we got, my bass beat and it knock
Got the old school in my old school 'bout to post up on yo' block
Yo broad chose like she was supposed to and you up in arms cause she bopped
Well I hate to say it but I got to say that I wish that they would just stop
So fuck these haters, fuck these hoes that ain't slammin doors on they drop
Y'all niggaz too young to remember how to the south used to be but I'm not
So when it come to snappin Cadillacs, +SpottieOttieDopaliscious+ y'all pop
You thought +Krit Wuz Here+ and +R4+ were the shit, bitch wait 'til my album drop
Say that's yo' new car? Nigga that's my old slab
Say that's yo' new bitch? Nigga that's my old stab
Oh that's yo' new flow? That shit sound so trash
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggaz

[Kendrick Lamar]
Hold up.... but don't forget about Compton nigga
One for the money, two for the show
Three for +No Limit+ and the rest for +Death Row+
That means I been +Bout It Bout It+ and this is the realest shit I ever wrote
And if anyone ever doubt it then they are the loudest of liars I know
I only desire to blow, she only desire to blow
and I hope that my dick is a whistlely flute, and that's not the instrumental
Now pick up my coat
You let that motherfucker drag like RuPaul, I'll drag yo' ass to the floor
Bitch I can admit, I'm a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is
Tellin the doctor I'm sick, head doctor I'm needing your lips, yea
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it then I won't ignore it, yea
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right when I floor it that's when I switched - gears
Living my life on Uranus, uh, keeping one foot in your anus, uh
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp 'til I break it, uh
Bitch I'm demandin respect, these bitches is tellin me take it
DJ Khaled, even if I had callus, holdin the torch ain't no challenge
Ain't it?

[Chorus]

Album:  Yellow Album (Mixtape)
Song:   We Ball
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
We ball, we drink
Fuck hoes, rock mink
New watch, gold links
She going down, no teeth

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
LA, that's me
You wanna meet somebody, ask me
You wanna see somebody, ask me
Ay, I tell her let's get in the back seat
Yo crew, last week
My niggas, mad deep
My bitch, bad piece
Yo bitch, got bad feet
I pray to God, I never flop
I get a loft, a better spot
Another Rollie, a better watch
I get a plane, and then a yacht
And my haters, let 'em watch
Line 'em up, give 'em shots
Don't save 'em, just let 'em drop
They said I'd never make it to the top
But we ball, take shots
I won another, it don't stop
Ya big mouth, a big Glock
I love you all, fuck the cops

[Bridge: x8]
We ball, bust shots

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Okay, I'm riding through Leimert, my tires in reverse
I'm lost but I know this foreign navigation works
I made a right on King, I seen a couple skirts
I said "bitch get in but dust them sandals off first"
Okay, I'm doing 105 on 105
Witnesses had said they seen a ball of fire
Bitch I'm tryna president at Jive while you talking jive
All these presidents, won't be surprised if one came alive
I only fuck with playas and pimps nigga
You a created player like Sims nigga
My cup be filled up to the brim nigga
Yo bitch fixing her make-up in my rims nigga
You just target practice
Everybody say they seen it but nobody know what happened
What happened yesterday baby girl fix your mood
Cause I don't like my head with some attitude
And I don't like your legs 'less they at the roof
Pedicure toward the ceiling, mollys in the cabinet too
Pop, pop, pop, popping pussy rather casual
Section 80 paid me ho so this is what I had to do
Ball, I ball
Iphone, million dollar missed calls
I hit the bank, withdrawals
I make her plank, with no drawls
Mothafucka I ball

[Outro: Ric Flair]
Just dying for me to go... Woo!</pre>

Artist: (Drake f/) Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Take Care
Song:   Buried Alive Interlude *
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

* begins after "Marvins Room" at the 5:44 mark on the CD version
  but separate as a digital track

[Intro]
Pine box, box
I would surely, break the lock
I'd jump right in and-and fall asleep, I-I'd fall asleep
Ca-ca-cause you, cause you are, the death of me
Cause you are, the
If you was in a, pine box, box
I would surely, break the lock
I'd jump right in and-and fall asleep, I-I'd fall asleep
Ca-ca-cause you, cause you are, the death of me
Cause you are, the, the, the death of me
You-you, the death of me

[Kendrick Lamar]
Lookin in the mirror I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin like a suicidal terrorist
We act like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in a matter of man arm wrestling
Hands I was dealt when I said the music business
was all I needed, when I got it I was greeted by an alien 
that said last year that she slept with a Canadian
that gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna has a lady friend
My vice is similar women, love when you're my type
And you're winnin from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel
Sin City, devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance, all cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein read 
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch "Yo' ass too fat, capitalize that"
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin device on your used 5 series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say we're in the area
Cruisin in Toronto, hit me on the cellular
Thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on stand-by when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up, Jeep no doors
All that nigga was missin was Aaliyah...
Felt like, the initiation
A reality livin in the matrix
We talked casually about the industry
and how the women be the taste-makers for the shit we makin
Then he said that he was the same age as
myself and it didn't help cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. O.V.O.X.O.
The reason why I'm breathin on the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend say she love more than life
but I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight 
was when he said you belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
and bury yourself alive, then I died</pre>

Album:  Revenge of the Dreamers III
Song:   Under the Sun
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: sample of The Argo Singers' "I'll Be Waiting For You"]
IIIIIIIIIf, you miss meeeee (ooooh ooooh ooooh ooooh)
And yooooooou, can't fiiiind, me nowhereeeee...

[J. Cole]
I done seen it all, oh my God
Uhh
I done seen it all, oh my God, I swear
Uhh, uhh

Nothin' new under the sun
Nobody fuckin' with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She diggin' me and I'm cuffin' her friend
She iggin' you while we fuckin' for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb
That's my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave
If I'm on the stage, an M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barkin', we send 'em astray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some moooooneyyyyyyy!
Ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with

[Kendrick Lamar]
Ayy!

[Lute]
Potato over my gun
I move in silence cause niggas be clockin' my funds
When they should keep eye on they bitch
cause baby girl comin' with son
Niggas be judgin' my moves, but please tell me what have you done?
My cousin'll air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezin'
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don't even need a reason
Loyalty over treason, bitch nigga come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a cold piece on them thangs
I'm Beatties Ford 'til the wheels fall
Know some niggas probably pissed off
Who would thought I made it this far?
Gold Mouf bitch, fuck 'em all

[Chorus]

[DaBaby]
I just put diamonds on all of my teeth
now they probably think I ain't intelligent
In the homicide unit interrogation askin' questions
You know I ain't tell 'em shit
Bitches call me a jock, all-American
I'm at the top of my class with my lettermen
I remember back in college
Bitches knockin' on my dorm door, I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm sellin' gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers, they mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire bitch, I'm lit but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
Reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a Glock with a dick, let's get physical
They gon' be hollerin' out "RIP" and they missin' you
They got me started, I might as well finish (talk your shit nigga)
I'm from Charlotte, you know how these niggas do
Baby

[Chorus]</pre>

Artist: Dr. Dre f/ Kendrick Lamar, King Mez, Marsha Ambrosius
Album:  Compton: A Soundtrack
Song:   Darkside / Gone
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

{*Part 1: Darkside*}

[Intro: King Mez]
Where you at? Where you from?
What you doin over here motherfucker?!
What you think? What you bang-bang?
This ain't no motherfuckin game

[King Mez]
Now I ain't never been no gangsta, but I know niggaz, know niggaz
From the darkside, there's some cold killers, cold killers (and man they used to tell me)
My nigga used to roll with us, roll with us (e'ry night)
Married into mo' money, mo' women
Now I ain't ever been the one that'll pull a gun on you, but I know who got 'em
No I never sold no drugs homie, but I know who got 'em
And I never had no fuckin bullets in me, but I know who got 'em
Hmmmmm, ay-ayy, ay-ayy
If you die tonight, you die tonight, momma might cry tonight
if she find you high off the dynamite, but to you it's just another Friday night
Got a nigga feelin kinda nice, with a Bible right beside that powder white
That's what this life is like (now do you love your life?!)

[Dr. Dre]
Now please don't give me a reason, reason
Cause I know you wanna keep breathin this evening
I've been killin the game for seasons, believe him
That I'm the motherfuckin one to breed 'em and lead 'em
In a league of my own, you ain't even made it up to my throne
You ain't even authorized for this song, might be best for you to get gone
Best be careful 'bout your tone, that shit hit me wrong and it's on
I've been tried my best to be calm, please don't make me grab that phone (uh-oh!)
Now who you know that came this fuckin far from the fuckin bottom?
30 years in this bitch, and I'm still here
Decade after decade
And evidently I must be doin somethin right, word to my nigga Eazy! {*echoes*}

{*Part 2: Gone*}

[Interlude]
{"Eazy-E, C-P-T, O.G. from the other side"} Eazy!
{"From the other side"} Eazy!

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But it's hard for me to believe it...
You'll find out when I'm gone

[Dr. Dre]
I went from hangin out down at the swap meet
To drivin some of the hottest cars L.A. has ever seen
People been tellin me I've grown into some kind of monster
But they don't know me though, I've been this way since 17
Tryna get finances poppin, man I thought that was the object
'til some of my niggaz lost they life and then there goes the team
My only dream was holdin it down like "Fuck who tryna stop us"
You can get the middle finger or the reddest beam
It's your choice, I took this industry by storm young and black, killin 'em softly
Don't ever call me fortunate, you don't know what it cost me
So anybody complainin about they circumstances lost me
Homie, we ain't even talkin, fuck that energy, fuck up off me
Uhh

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
You look at my lifestyle, I'm livin my life now
I'm dealin with diligent Benjamin, how come my attitude piped down?
I'm fuckin with Ice now
I'm fuckin with shit that you only can get on an overseas flight now
You scared of my heights now
But still I got enemies givin me energy, I don't wanna fight now
Subliminal sent to me all of this hate, I thought I was holdin the mic down
I thought I was holdin my city up, I thought I was good in the media
You think I'm too hood in my video? But really no clue, you idiot~!
I, just can't help myself
Even when that record spin every now and then you hang yo'self
Cause I got the green and gold with a million sold, plus plenty mo' of a dollar figure
But with or without the diamonds though, to you I'm just another nigga!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Marsha Ambrosius]
You'll find out when I'm gone</pre>

Artist: Dr. Dre f/ Anderson .Paak, Justus, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Compton: A Soundtrack
Song:   Deep Water
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro]
Where you from nigga?

"What is going on in Compton? I don't understand it."
"Well, as it relates to this, this is not in my field as the clerk.
 So anything that relates to this,
 you'd probably have to get an answer from, Dr. Dre."

[Dr. Dre]
I hear you talkin 'bout respect, I gave you niggaz the utmost (the utmost)
All you niggaz the utmost (the utmost)
Would you look over Picasso's shoulder and tell him 'bout his brush strokes?
Them opinions, I don't trust those
I apologize, the city made a nigga so cut-throat
Every hood love me but it started on one coast
Could've stopped in '86 but I knew that you would want mo'
I'm on a throne in a place some niggaz won't go

[Chorus: Dr. Dre] + (Justus)
Don't get it fucked up~!
(Been away from home - been away from home)
(In L.A. been gone that long)
(All they wanna know is, where you from? Where you from?)
Where you from nigga, huh? COMPTON!

[Dr. Dre]
Psst, this is about where I'm from
I think it's time to take these niggaz to the deep water
Yeah, down in the Pacific (the Pacific, the Pacific)
Where them sharks at nigga, down in the deep water
Listen, listen, listen, all you niggaz swimmin in the info
Go fuck around and drown in the specifics
Always goin overboard, used to be my kinfolk
Now you're sleepin with the muh'fuckin fishes
(What the bid'ness? With the muh'fuckin fishes, what the bid'ness?)
These niggaz won't let up until they all wet up
Don't get fucked up!
Naw nigga, now everybody wanna visit
Tryna re-up that prescription (that prescription)
Yup, yeah, re-up! Cause my nigga
Water colors couldn't even paint the picture
They don't get the picture, fuck 'em (yeah, fuck 'em)
Yeah, drugs by the dozen (what?)
You might just wanna go and check the children
(You might just wanna check your fuckin children)
Yeah~! I'm the one that got they ear
For many years I've been makin parents live in fear
I just wanna make it clear
My influence run deep like the ocean

[Chorus]

[Anderson .Paak]
Feels like you're drowning, don't ya?
About a hundred miles down in that ocean
(About a hundred miles down in that)
It's over (it's over)
Shoulda never jumped in if you can't swim
(Can't swim, if you can't swim)
Oh my God, where's a lifeguard when you need one?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Motherfucker know I started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle
Mixin up with Similac, my momma knew I had a problem
Wasn't thinkin 'bout no rappin, I was jookin for a dollar
Puttin quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla (holla)
No releasin me, I got the beast in me, I got to (holla)
Keep the decency and makin T-N-T my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer
Inner-city bullet fly 'til that bitch on auto-pilot
AHHHHHHHH-H-H-H, SHIT!
I don't give a fuck about your whereabout
All I care about is wearin out your area and airin out
your upper body when I catch ya walkin out your parents' house
(Don't get fucked up) Homie got fucked up
tryna park his tour bus not knowin what's what
or who's who, livin in the L.A. county zoo
Pick 'em off like a big dog, motherfucker, WOOF!
Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (boom boom boom!)
I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicin (boom boom boom!)
That's when I realized bangin wasn't for e'rybody
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
They liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
They worry him to death but he no vegetarian
The beef is on his breath, inheritin the drama better than
a great white, nigga this is life in my AQUARIUM!

[Chorus]

[Marsha Ambrosius]
This is about where I'm from
I think it's time to take these niggaz to the deep water
Yeah, down in the Pacific
Where them sharks at, nigga down in the deep water

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
{*gasps for air*} Help me!
(Feels like you're drowning, drowning)
Ah! {*gasps for air*}
(Down in that)
{*gasps for air*} Help me, help me!
Help me, somebody help me
(Shoulda never jumped in if you can't, if you can't swim)
Help me {*gasps for air*}
Help me, help me, help me, help me!
I can't, I can't breathe, I can't breathe!
I can't breathe, help
(Where's a lifeguard when you need one?)
God, please, please help, please {*drowning*}
Please help me! {*drowning*}
Please help! Please help!
Please... please...</pre>

Artist: Dr. Dre f/ Candice Pillay, Kendrick Lamar, Marsha Ambrosius
Album:  Compton: A Soundtrack
Song:   Genocide
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro: Marsha Ambrosius]
Stone cold killers in these Compton streets
One hand on the .9, all eyes on me
Murder, heh, murder, heh
Murder, heh, murder, heh
Call 9-1-1 emergency
Hands up in the air for the world to see
It's murder, heh, it's murder, heh
Murder, heh, murder, heh, murder

[Candice Pillay]
My dada done kill 'em dere (yea!)
Bullet to the dome, to the head
My dada done kill a yout'
Dun fi pull apart that man and (HURRY UP!)
What it look like?
See my dada done kill 'em dead (yea!)
Bullets come down from the earth
My dada done kill a yout'
Dun fi pull apart that man and (HURRY UP!)
What it look?

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
There's the stone cold killers in these Compton streets
One hand on the .9, all eyes on me
Murder, heh, murder, heh
It's murder, heh, it's murder, heh
Call 9-1-1 emergency
Hands up in the air for the world to see
It's murder, heh, it's murder, heh
Murder, heh, murder, heh, murder

(It's been a 1-8-7 in this bitch!)

[Dr. Dre]
Murder, that's murder, listen, hear that Suburban whippin?
Tinted windows right at your wifey (blap!) and I bet you miss her
We load up pro tools, and we throw that clip in both trays
That's one in the left hand, one in the right hand, Scottie Pippen both ways
Been doin drive-bys, got this music industry timelined
Lookin like Rosecrans when these niggaz throw up them signs high
I'm talkin about the bottom where it's high crimes
Well shit, I'm just tryna get paid and keep them thighs high (thighs high)
Sometimes I feel like I could just bury 'em, bury 'em
Cause delirium, mass hysteria, a scarier area
I'm very aware hip-hop needed somethin to carry it
So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot
And you way too fuckin close, beware of the barrier
This is Hub City nigga, don't make us embarrass ya
Now you should be realistic, these niggaz 'round here ballistic
We did the numbers and you lookin like another statistic

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Ahhhhh, recognize whatever side the sides reside until the dead has risen
Live in a project building, dodgin the module ceilings
I ride, I'ma ride in a stolen jeep
Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (corrupted)
Momma tried counselin, five plans for Kendrick (but fuck it)
My family ties had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (abducted)
Aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (disgusting)
Our stadium's packed, Raiders in black
Curls drippin, silver bullet, palladium in my strap
I lie on the side of a one-way street (blow blow blow blow!)
Nowhere to go, death all I can see (blow blow, blow blow!)
I say "Fuck is up?" I fuck 'em up, your supper's up or something's up
I hopin all get orthotist, rope it before the double dutch
broke, plenty ruckus with this weapon I protect it under oath
My discretion, fuck yo' blessin, fuck yo' life, fuck yo' hope
FUCK yo' momma, FUCK yo' daddy, FUCK yo' dead homie
FUCK the world UP when we came up, this Compton homie!

[Interlude]
Murderrrrrrr, murder
Murder, murder
It's all murderrrrrrrr (ohhhhhh)
Murder (mmmm-hmmmmmmm)

[Outro]
Murder, murder, murder, murder
(It's murder)
(It's been a 1-8-7 in this bitch!)</pre>

Artist: Droop-E f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Rossi Wine (Free My Mind) (S)
Song:   Rossi Wine (Free My Mind)
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Droop-E]
Uh, yeah

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Droop-E)
Sipping on that Rossi wine, puffing turtle, feeling fine
It's just me, myself and I, all I need to free my mind
Nigga, nigga, I'm out chere
Nigga, nigga, nigga, I'm out chere
(Puffing turtle, feeling fine, sipping Carlo Rossi wine
 It's just me, myself and I, all I need to free my mind)
Nigga, nigga, I'm out chere
Nigga, nigga, nigga, I'm out chere

[Droop-E]
Yeah, uh, don't worry bout what's in my cup
Sipping on that purple stuff, and I ain't talking syrup bruh
Carlo Rossi wine, Burgundy, ask about Droop-E
I guarantee your bitch has heard of me with the urgency
She just want to suck success, smoke turtle
We call it turtle cause it's green and it makes you move slow
Donatello, green and purple, ain't no suckers in my circle
Money on my mental, heavy on my grizzle
This ain't a 'movie', they'll rob you for your 'Dinero'
Droop-E

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh, in the middle of the war zone, I be on
Sipping on a big bottle of that Burgundy, motherfuck your styrofoam
Big barrel, baritone, and it sound like Barry White
And it boom like an 808, turn your ass to a parasite
On the freeway I ride to the snare, don't get me out my loop my nigga
A bad bitch, I ride with a pair/pear, like the fruit my nigga
The paparazzi gone shoot my nigga
But I don't pay 'em no attention, I'ma put 'em in detention
Head of the class, head in the E-class with the technician
You see it, I know that you see it
More company? I probably don't need it

[Chorus]

"Top of the line wine, Carlo Rossi
 Drinking on some of that top of the line wine, Carlo Rossi
 Top of the line wine, Carlo Rossi
 Drinking on some of that top of the line wine, Carlo Rossi" - E-40

Album:  The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 3
Song:   Catch a Fade
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (E-40)
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go, street sweeper
Monday to Friday, if not though we can catch a fade
(Catch a fade!) Catch a fade
(Catch a fade!) Catch a fade
(Catch a fade!) Catch a fade
(Catch a fade!)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Pulling up and hopping out, shell, catch it popping out
And I ain't never been a Tom or a Jerry, pussy or a rat
Pussy on my nut sack, carry plenty Kenny Tates
Give me that, give me plenty Feddi
Federales on my back, pack 'em in the cemetery
Send a scary hit out on your messenger, I'm ignorant to wrestle a
gorilla in the center of an Acura Integra
I'm pissed off, so I piss off rooftops
Drink it through a straw, fuck a rent-a-cop, I'm hot
I'm napalm when the beat slap like eight palms
And I wear eight charms, every airport alarm
go off till they tackle me, what I do wrong?
Nigga, it ain't bout the chain, nigga, you the fucking bomb
Bomb on a bitch nigga, then his bitch later
Pull the tips on a bitch nigga, you a fucking waiter
I don't even want a favor, I just want a fair one
And it's like that till the sheriffs come

[Chorus]

[Droop-E]
Droop-E, look, problems we solved 'em, bout that action
One less sucker nigga, that's subtraction
There's bosses, factors on the team
Real niggas, no actors on the team
Not you, who Droop? He a good dude
Put him in a bad mood, turn you into goon food
I'm in the party feeling like me
S-I-C-K with T.D.E.
Your bitch on sacks, in my ear like wax
and this Landy got her ready to get it hit from the back
She chose up chump, salute, give daps
or get your face flat, you don't want that
And get your nose tapped, you don't want that
Get your life fucked up all over a batch
Get cropped, get chopped
on your head like a barber shop
Have it out in the parking lot

[Chorus]

[E-40]
Stay turned, super charged up, stoked
Ghetto pass never revoked, mouthpiece faster than a speedboat
Keep it one hundred like a C-note, pea coat
Popo tryna decode lingo
Not drunk, but I finna be hella twisted
Lifted like a toilet seat, grown ass kid
My bitch always telling me, I ain't shit
She hate me, but she love my dick
Trapper factor macker, having money like a rapper (rapper)
Bumping local talent, pulling up with the blapper (blapper)
Partner want to challenge cause my pockets hella fatter (fatter)
But he gon' be unlucky like walking under a ladder (ladder)
Put hands on a man, fuck unity (fuck unity)
Ain't nothing between us, but space and opportunity (space and opportunity)
Never been a sucker (sucker), never been a lame
Stay in your lane, you can't see me like a stealth plan (like a stealth plane)
Biatch~!

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar] + (E-40) + {Droop-E}
(Where you from Droop-E?) {The West}
(Where you from Kendrick? The West
Aye 40, where you from though? (The West)
Who bring it to they front do'? (The West)
Aye, where they get they game from? (The West)
Aye, where they get they slang from? (The West)
Aye, where they get they strength from? (The West)
Aye, where they get they greats from (The West, biatch~!)</pre>

Artist: Eminem f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  The Marshall Mathers LP 2
Song:   Love Game
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Eminem]
Somethin's burnin, I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust, judgment is clouded, must
just be the powder from the power of
{"LOVE"} but I'm in somethin I don't know how to get outta
Left my girl in the house alone, IS THAT MY soon-to-be spouse's moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard, cause after all this is her place
so I give her the benefit of the doubt I
think I might be about to - Busta-Bust her
The thought's scary yo though and it hurts, BRACE
Hope it ain't, "Here we go yo" cause my head already goes to worst CASE
+Scenario+ though in the first PLACE
(Aw, fuck) But you confirmed my +Low End Theory+ though
Should've known when I made it all the way to +3rd Bass+
And that was only the first DATE, could've made it to home PLATE
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face - first
"No {*slurp*} you don't {*slurp*} under {*slurp*} stand {*slurp*}
I {*slurp*} don't {*slurp*} do this for {*hic*} anyone {*hic*} ever" {*slurp*}
Yeah that ain't what they all say, I'll say
You can suck a softball through a straw, used to be my fiancée
'til you sucked on Wayne, André and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame!
Guess I'm gettin my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?
Cause your name I'm +Beyon'+ sayin
But fuck it I'm movin on, you women are all cra'y
But I'll probably always keep on playin the

[Interlude: sample of Wayne Fontana & The Mindbreakers]
"Game of love (love) love (love)"
"La-la, la-la-la-love!"

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me, like she never did before
And I told her
{"Go where you wanna, go do what you wanna do, I don't care"}
And I told her
{"Go where you wanna, go do what you wanna do, I don't care"}

[Kendrick Lamar]
I told that bitch - I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick
Suckin dick in your momma tub then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter - you beat the case and I called ya
{*beep*} "Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
and Kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those
expensive heels, you little fuckin ferris wheel
Fuckin spinnin on me, fuck you think we're gon' get married still?
Fuckin Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fuckin feel
like you should fuckin beat it or fuckin eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day~!" {*beep*} Bitch you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
why you ain't fuckin with me, you cut me deep as Cesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
after the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin cordial, yeah I got some home trainin
That ain't what you like, ain't it? What about if I was famous
as Marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin - "I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile, you're chasin her"
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feelin betrayed, snatch my house key off her keychain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from "The Wire"'s dick now she's chasin me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché, it's all my fault anyway
She's turnin the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ, each day is an instant replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of attack beha-
-vior, back together, but forgot today was her b-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstandin, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
that's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin brake line, stepped on them fuckers eight times, still goin 73 thank
God there's an exit comin up, what the mother-F-U-C-K's
wrong with her? Hit the off-ramp 'til I coasted
to a gosh damn halt, hit a fuckin tree, now
here she comes at full speed, she's racin at me, okay you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window, she's screamin
I body slam her on the cement until the concrete gave
And created a sinkhole, buried the stink hoe in it then paid to have the street re-paved!
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
in a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, cause she's layin next to me in bed
DIRECTLY AIMIN A GAT AT MY HEAD!
Woke up again and jumped up like "Fuck it, I've had it!"
I'm checkin into rehab, I confess I'm a static addict
I guess that's why I'm so clingy, every girl I've ever had 
either says I got too much baggage or I'm too fuckin dramatic
Man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin romantic
I fuckin love you, you fuckin bitch! Combative, possessive
In fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said "Hit the road" then after she left I sent that bitch a text
that said "Be careful drivin, don't read this and have a accident," she glanced to look at it and wrecked!
Too bad, thought we had a connect, no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace
who fell from grace eleven stories for story telling while the whore was yelling rape
'til her vocal chords were swelling and her voice was more hoarser/horser than Tori Spelling's FACE!
Still they swarm the gates
of my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates don't ask me for a date, though you're late
Well the sentiment's great - but wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate

Artist: Flying Lotus f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  You're Dead!
Song:   Never Catch Me
Typed by: en13712n@gmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
I can see the darkness in me and it's quite amazing
Life and death is no mystery and I wanna taste it
Step inside of my mind and you'll find curiosity, animosity
high philosophy, hyper prophesied meditation
Reminisce on my wonder years and I wonder here
Sentiments of my words ain't been so sincere
The sentiment of my nerves that I just persevere
The big thought of fallin' off disappeared to my fate
They say that Heaven's real
Analyze my demise, I say I'm super anxious
Recognize I deprive this fear and then embrace it
Vandalizin' these walls only if they could talk
Conversations won't contemplate to my dark thoughts
Lookin' down on my soul now, tell me I'm in control now
Tell me I can live long and I can live wrong and I can live right
and I can sing song and I can unite with you that I love
You that I like, look at my life and tell me I fight
This that final destination, this that find some information
This that find some inspiration, this that crack, the instillation
This that quantum jump and that fist pump and that bomb detonation
Please don't bomb my nation, embalming fluid waiting
I got mind control when I'm here, you goin' hate me when I'm gone
Ain't no blood pumpin' no fear, I got hope inside of my bones
This that life beyond your own life, this ain't physical for mankind
This that out-of-body experience, no coincidence you been died
Bitch, you're dead!

...

[Kendrick Lamar]
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me...
Say you will never ever catch me...</pre>

Artist: Focus... f/ Kendrick Lamar, Pro-Verb, Ras Kass, Latoiya Williams
Album:  Pay Homage
Song:   Homage to Daz & Soopafly
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

{Sound without Focus... is just noise.}

[Pro-Verb]
We gon' party with y'all a little bit (okay!)
It's my tribute to the West, tight..

With so much knock in the LBC 
It was hard not to claim that DPG
Summertime popped in the L-A-C
with the music courtesy of D-A-Z
and the Soopa, Doopa, Fly for the troopers
riders, supers, hoes, groupies
All of 'em with the short tight jeans on
"Let's Play House" all of 'em theme song
Word on the gangsta, squad up!
Black, brown, throw a St. Ides up (Eastside~!)
..then the West got harder
And Soopafly hit 'em on the head on "Tha Doggfather"
Don't nobody party like the West though
G-Funk been the sound since Death Row
Where you think we got the kicked-in clap at?
Time to bring it back, bitch, and it's like that

[Chorus: Latoiya Williams]
Only in L.A. (Only in L.A.)
Where the gangstas play (Where the gangstas play)
Catchin up on fame
Summertime in, West Coast ride

[Ras Kass]
I'm +Focus-ed+ man..
I'm about that shit, hoe, gotta get this money
Long Beach, C-R-Son, all the shit is sunny
Put the monkey in it, like the shit is funny
Banana Clip Rassy 'bout to spit this dummy
But funkers told me to kick back
I like revenge, retaliation, and getback, nigga!
Got more bars than Kit-Kat
Get smacked like Katt Stacks if you lip jack
A muh'fucker betta recognize
With a flick of my wrist like a Vulcan, you all die!
All I do is ball high
Tryna stay above the rim like a tall guy
Dat Nigga Daz, Soopafly, alright
Lexus {?}, left lanes, all ride
OG to BG, I thought I warn ya
+Only... in California+!

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Movin down Rosecrans, bumpin D-A-Z
Feelin like 1-9-9-3, only one to the 710
I'm in Long Beach, home of Dillinger
dealin the gangsta shit, gangsta killa
You wankstas quit fillin ya iPod up with classics
Ain't a nigga out could match them ad-libs (Woo!)
D-P-G-C General
Gin on my breath while Jennifer hold my genitals
Yeah it's llike that cause I was taught that
Back when "Dogg Food" dropped in the Compton Swap Meet parking lot
Daddy V had three, sold one to my pops
We was poppin out, the trunk in the Caddy was rockin out
Slap a nigga in the FACE with the 808s'
Even made Pac salute, snares like a BEAR trap
They're un-BEARable too, BEAR witness
Hits like BAR-RY Bonds, Daz the REALEST!
...Nigga!

[Chorus]</pre>

Song:   Bend Ya
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
All the spoons in my kitchen
(Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
(They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
(Bend, I bend, I bend, I bend)
Bend it girl, bend it girl

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh, soon as I enter
I put a hurtin on it if I don't kill it she injured
For a long time, summer, spring and winter
Fall for anything, you clumsy ass nigga
Jumping off the boat in some eighty-seven locs
She's seen them hundred spokes, and then that woman spoke
But I don't talk back,I put my life on tracks
If that don't work put your wife on track
Show me where the candle wax, it must be you
Because I burn right through everything y'all do
High octane when I bring on my last name
Mr. Lamar a.k.a "The Cash King"
Quicker than pre-cum won't you give her a reason
to not meet/meat up with me like a vegan
Psssh! God Damn I'm the fuckin man
She said fuck her man, now she fuck with man

{"808 Mafia"}

{"Tarentino"}

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
These niggas changed, they got jealous on me
Try to rob, I got that felon on me
I can't leave the country cause I'm a felon homie
And I don't trust these niggas, they be tellin' on me
And I don't trust these bitches, they be plottin' on me
Everybody ain't real, you gotta watch homie
Niggas say they real, but they acting funny
These niggas changed and got jealous on me {*echoes*}

[Kendrick Lamar]
I don't trust these niggas, I don't trust these bitches
Drunk right now, so you know I meant it... {"808 Mafia"}

If you know me then you know, nigga, Chi-Town like my second home
I done flew a private jet for some Harold's Chicken straight from Rome
I done bust down on a few thots, Fredo hit me on my phone
"Nigga I can't talk right now {*thong thong thong thong*} got pussy on my tongue"
I got worry on my brain, I been gone all summer
Just to fly back home and found out y'all done killed my little brother
Shit is fucked up on these streets, why the fuck would I think about some rap beef?
Nigga I got bigger fish to fry now, empty out my account and I'll pay for sleep
Where's my bottle? Money change and people change and people come
And people go and act estranged; I'm aggravated cause they hated, confirmation for success
Anticipated, I can taste it, I can chase it, back down with, liquor
I could drown out, my sorrows, but I, ain't a, sorry, ass, nigga
Get up, off your, ass, make yourself a hundred racks
Bitch, get up, off your, ass, throw it back, back, back
Back inside my 'Bach, back in a garage that we can jack
Bitch I love my hood; I'm strapped up, what's good? Heard someone said {"808 Mafia"}

[Chorus]

[Fredo Santana]
Jealous on me...
Jeal-J-Jealous...

Comin' up, gotta watch who you hang with
I'm still with the same niggas I came with
On the block with the same niggas I banged with
If you ain't talkin' money I don't know your language
I come from that very very bottom
Now I'm gettin' money and I'm seein' stardom
My niggas savage, don't start 'em
We up them guns, if it's a fuckin' problem
Money comin' in, don't have money problems
Kicked your bitch out cause she ain't wanna swallow
All these bitches thots, acting like models
Fredo, I'm the king of Chicago
Gotta .30 and I fill it up with hollows
Got bricks and I feel like El Chapo
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit bitch
Since I'm a rich nigga, I need a rich bitch

[Chorus]

[Fredo Santana]
Jealous on me, jealous on me, jeal-jealous
Jealous on me, jealous on me.. jeal-jealous
Jealous on me, jealous on me, jeal-jeal-jealous on me
Jealous on me, jealous on me... {"808 Mafia"}</pre>

Artist: Funkmaster Flex f/ Bridget Kelly, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Who You Mad At? Me or Yourself?
Song:   Street Dreamin
Typed by: Gemini_20502K@Yahoo.com

[Intro: Funkmaster Flex] (Kendrick Lamar)
FUNK FLEX! (BK!) KENDRICK LAMAR!
TY TY WHATTUP?! WHO YOU MAD AT ME OR YOURSELF?! (Just watch! Uh Hah!)

[Verse One: Kendrick Lamar]
Take a trip with the narcoleptic
Suffered insomnia but this time it was only seconds
I seek thermometers boil have you lay in the desert
Of eternal fire hatred denied yourself of a blessing
Meanwhile I'm on a new cloud chuckin the deuce
Uh! With new vows with sinners, homies, enemies too
Uh! Gold towel under my feet clickin the flute  
With a thousand troops crip and piru, nigga woop woot! (AIYYO WHAT'S HAPPENIN WIT' IT GANGSTA?!)
Uh! Love I depend on white doves I depend on
They flyin through this end zone that meant on to vent on
So listen homie, you miss me with that bullshit
I keep my distance homie (Homie) I'm on a higher pulpit
You cannot visit homie, I mean the beauty of heaven 
Is far from me not to exit it's like an antidepressant
You see the vision homie? I mean this godly advice 
Fuckin right, even if you pinch me twice, yes I, keep dreamin

[Verse Two: Bridget Kelly]
Lovely lullabies, I don't see another 
Thing but starry skies, pillows of clouds beneath my wings
And endless nights, as far as hazy eyes can see
The sun will rise, and illuminate this fly
(This fly) Oh why (Oh why) 
Do I (Do I) Have to return to reality
(Oh I) This time (This time) I'll try (I'll try) 
I'll try, not to wake up from this dream

[Chorus: Bridget Kelly]
(Street dreamin far from believin) I won't wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin) I can't wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin) I won't wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin, street dreamin, street...)

[Verse Three: Bridget Kelly]
I will not forget, fixating the part of
Faith I never met, explain no way all the 
Reasons as I slept, so beautiful in here
I wish, I never left, I never know it was a lie
(This lie) Oh I! (Oh I!) Do I (Do I)  
Do I (Do I) Have to return to reality
(Oh I) This time (This time) I'll try (I'll try) 
I'll try, not to wake up from this dream

[Chorus: Bridget Kelly]
(Street dreamin far from believin) Hey! Said I won't wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin) No! Said I won't wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin) No! No No No!wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin, street dreamin, street...)

[Bridge: Bridget Kelly]
I won't open my eyes again I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again I'll keep them shut

[Outro: Bridget Kelly]
(Street dreamin far from believin) Not to wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin) I won't wake up from this dream

Album:  Mask Off (Remix) {S}
Song:   Mask Off (Remix)
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Future]
Call it how it is, Hendrix
I promise, I swear, I swear
{"If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you"}
You heard, spit it, yo

[Chorus: Future]
Percocet, molly, Percocets 
Percocet, molly, Percocets 
Rep the set, gotta rep the set 
Chase a check, never chase a bitch (never chase no bitches)
Mask on, fuck it, mask off 
Mask on, fuck it, mask off 
Percocet, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch (never chase no bitches)

[Future]
Two cups, toast up with the gang (gang gang)
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain
Out the bottom, I'm the livin' proof (super)
Ain't compromisin', half a million on a Coupe (gang gang)
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru (whoa whoa whoa)
Graduated, I was overdue
Pink molly, I can barely move (barely)
Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James, thirty-three chains (thirty-three)
Ocean air, cruisin' Biscayne (big foreign)
Top off, that's a liability (big foreign)
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline (big foreign)

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Future]
Four-door Maybach, I drive anythang
Buy my Range, make 'em go insane
("Oh my Lord") DJ EscoMoe City
("Praise him be") 

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I got a halo, I level up every time God say so
Shooter on payroll, lookin' like Pancho, lookin' like Pedro
Money tree from Tarzan, ten dividends gon' grow when I say "grow"
Kung Fu Kenny with the Midas touch, ain't no penny that I don't touch
All my enemy bite on dust, ain't no talkin' when it's fatal
Havin' heart, I can't tell (wait) half of y'all might need help (wait)
I might fall in Rodeo (bitch) I might ball in Australia (say no more)
I might call her for real (say no more) all the ass gon' unveil
Wind blows in the windows and I snuck in when the vent close
She copy like 10-4, know who we sent for
Platinum platinum platinum, gotta look at 'self and ask what happened
How y'all let a conscious nigga go commercial while only makin' conscious albums?
How y'all let the braids on TV? How y'all let the hood at the table?
Now y'all don't even know how to rate him, niggas lookin' like I'm a created player
Everybody who didn't pay respect, gotta 'fess up now and pay ya debts
Gotta lay somethin' down if makin' threats, gotta say somethin' now, don't hold ya breath
I mean I'm floatin', I got the sauce, got the potion, I got 'em all in convulsions 
And emotions, I put careers in negotions and put the body in the ocean
I made an oath when my nigga told me to go in then he died on a cold bench
All my old friends livin' life on a slow end, gotta keep shit rollin'
It's deep (it's deep)
I done fucked so much, I can't sleep (I can't sleep)
I done fucked so much, I'm retired (I swear to God)
I'm 'bout to live my life through Dave Free (swear to God)
She said she broke down when Prince died (it's alright)
Bitch my hair down, Prince live through me (I am Prince)
Get your ass up and be inspired (get inspired)
You know how many bodies in the street (how many?) take the mask off so you can see

[Chorus]

[Outro: Future]
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Gas gone, never nod off

--- The City ---
Artist: The Game f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  The R.E.D. Album
Song:   The City
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

{"Leave the angels in the city..."}
{"Leave the angels in the city..."}

[Game]
Tell them motherfuckers I'm forever paid
California king, wrestle gators in the Everglade
Drive up out that motherfuckin swamp, in a Escalade
So before you put that red rag in your pocket I wanna see your fuckin résumé
Started off on ground zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole, I never hesitate
Dre beats on, smokin that chronic just to meditate
I'ma give 'em hurricanes until another levee break
You niggaz is featherweight, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
When the nigga Wack found me, shit, I was sellin weight
Now a nigga's sellin millions, NOW it's time to celebrate!
Permormin in front of millions, nigga every race
6'4" in a '6-4, now watch the Chevy scrape
Fourth album, no 5 Mics? Then let 'em hate
But I'm not stoppin 'til I'm the fuckin king in EVERY state!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
{"Leave the angels in the city"}
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, I'm a ragin +Bull+ when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me
Tell 'em they can find me in the dark with the ghetto children
Look in my heart, nigga fuck yo' feelings
This is ME!

[Game]
I'm sick of motherfuckers talkin 'bout the West died
Can't you hear my heart beatin? {*heart thumps twice*}
That's the motherfuckin Westside!
You test me you test God, I'm his son
And sayin psalms you come at me, then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You won't have no time to run
I'm from the Compton slums and that's how the West ride
I'm from the city where, two of the best died
Rest in peace to both of 'em; spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Damn, I said I'll spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em
Matter fact shorten your list, nigga top 5
Game, Biggie, Hov, prol'ly 'Pac, Nas
No particular order, bet a mil' that I slaughter
and SERVE niggaz, give a FUCK what you ordered
How DARE you niggaz pop fly?
When I'm the nigga sold five mil' out the gate and numbers do NOT lie!

[Chorus]

[Game]
I gave you the "Documentary,", shit was a classic
Gave you "Doctor's Advocate,", you ripped it out the package
Came with "LAX", since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in a scope
Spillin red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waitin for
I'm the lost angel knockin on Satan's door
What the fuck y'all take me for? I love you cause you hate me more
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor except I give you 84
Shake you like Haiti's floor
Walk up on you like "What's goin on baby boy?" SHOTS in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy or the black Slim Shady or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more?
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Heh, and I wear a pendant, on my shoulder, soldier
Like a lieutenant, and the coupe tenant, got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down
Knowin damn well we don't wanna see the +box+ like Manny Pacquiao
Lil' nigga Mayweather size
Ride like 'Pac in his prime, +Thug Life+ is now on radar
'Til a federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin when the L.A. Raiders, was in my home
Snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone, dick-ridin
I'm addicted to, West-sidin
Livin in a city where the skinny niggaz die
and the semi bullet fly but it turn me to a lion
Tryin (try-tryin, tryin, tryin, tryin, tryin)
And I mean that shit!
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city where the nigga had seen that shit
Compton, a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never TV screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit

[Outro: JoiStaRR]
Red, is a very emotionally intense color.
It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate,
and raises blood pressure.
It has very high visibility, 
which is why stop signs, stoplights and fire equipment are usually painted red.
It also represents one-third of California's gang population.
Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area.
Also, tuck your jewelry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle.
Thank you! Enjoy.

Artist: The Game f/ Dr. Dre, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  The Documentary 2
Song:   On Me
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro: sample of "On and On" by Erykah Badu]
"On and on, and on and"
"On-on and on, and on and"
"On-on and on, and on and"
"On-on and on, and on and"

[The Game]
Back when Dot, was hangin out at Top's in the Benzo
Freestylin to them "Chronic" instrumentals, no pens and pencils
I was out there Blood'in like a menstrual
With a Backwood clinched between my dentals
Way back when, when we was outside with the indo
Hotboxin rentals in front of Centennial
Remedial thoughts, never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic, fuck bitches, ride around, bouncin shit
From Impalas to that Harley truck
To dish-raggin bitches that was hard to fuck, I came up, it was hardly luck
Just left Compton, and I ain't have to use my AK
{"What a day, what a day"}

[Kendrick Lamar]
Back when my driver's license, was babyfaced and triflin
I made my way through crisis
I made my tape and recorded portraits in front of sirens, I made you hate the vibrant
You can't escape the tyrant, you can't relate where I've been
In '98 my problem, actin too grown and shit
Cappin at bitches, yeah my religion through songs and shit
On me, that's on me
Raise up nigga you are not the homie
Bitch I'm well-connected from my +Section+ down to Long Beach
Fumblin with Tetris if your block neglectin yo' ki'
Every day I wake up with my face up to my Father
Makin sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest
All my green is stuffin, double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality, my déjà vu done caught up
Bitch I'm brought up - with the homies, that's on me
24/7, Kendrick reppin these cold streets
Don't we, live by it, die by it, then reincarnate
And if Game told me, drive by it, I raise AK~!
Ain't no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that I'll play
Like no name on it, blindsided, ain't no one safe~!
"Documentary" had identities of where I'm from
Therefore my energy had to make sure the better me won
It ain't no better one son, it ain't no tellin me none
Nigga that's Chuck, Doc Dre and K, the legacy's DONE!
BLAOW!

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Awww man
You thought these Niggaz Wit Attitude'll show gratitude?
Fooled you
From 2015 to infinity it's still bomb weed and Hennessy
I can +Pimp a Butterfly+ for the energy
Game, I need acapella

[The Game] + (Dr. Dre)
Here I go, gimme a minute nigga!
'Bout to hit a home run, K-Dot, grab the pennant nigga
Pin it on my Pendleton, trap +Late Night+, Jay Leno and them
Got my momma a tennis bracelet, Wimbledon or Wilmington
Now can I rap for a minute? Black on the track for a minute?
Look in my rhyme book, see/C Murder like when I was a fan of No Limit
Ain't no gimmicks 'round here, this Compton, me Doc and Kendrick
+Chronic+, +good kid+, my first shit, three +Documentaries+
Now I'm blockin sentries, 16 Impalas, they bounce like they Iguodala
That's on my momma, niggaz up and did me a solid
(I put that on me, that's on me)
(You get a bullet fuckin with the lil' homie) {*blam*}
Thinkin back then like fuck your rules, nigga this is Piru
Slide through with the Erykah Badu, Westside Compton, nigga don't mind if I do
From Piru Street to my old street, nigga this Compton, grew up on a dead end
Got an armful of dead friends, 'round here Crips be sweatin us niggaz like a headband
Like "What's up cuz?" (Sup cuz, where you from?) No time to stop and think
Pull your strap before they do or you get shot before you blink
+Straight Outta Compton+, three times I told you, the third time I said it
with TDE motherfucker, I'll make you eat every letter
Spoon-feed you niggaz like toddlers, from the city of Impalas
Where shot-callers take they Pit bulls and feed them niggaz Rottweilers
My clip full, I quick pull, no more slangin 8-balls on the corner
And all them niggaz I used to freestyle with, I ate y'all on the corner
Call the coroner, niggaz dead out here, hangin onto life by a thread out here
Them niggaz wearin all that red out here, P snapbacks on niggaz head out here
So don't, you come fuckin with the little homie
So O.G., they call me Tony
Montana, no French, my red bandana legit
My uncle told me before he died, "Just keep yo' hand on the brick"
So I did, sell every chicken that a nigga had in stock
Yes I did, walked to Compton, hot pocket full of rocks
Yes I did, skipped class; yes I did, whooped niggaz ass
Yes I did, fuck a bitch behind the bleachers while on the rag
That's on Bloods, Westside, that's on Bloods, this Tec fly, that's on Bloods
You fuck with Dot, I'll let you choke on your blood
I put that

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
Raise up nigga you are not the homie
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
Raise up nigga you are not the homie

Album:  Jesus Piece
Song:   See No Evil
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Game]
I don't read the XXL
Tote a .45, the church think I'm destined for hell, oh well
Blood tears off the face of my Jesus piece
It's bloodshed, feel the cracks in my city streets
I'm from the crack of them city streets
Used to sell crack in them city streets - born in Blood nigga
In a coma five days, life of a thug nigga
Momma ain't show, grandma almost pulled the plug nigga
Used to pull the gun out, just because of cuz niggaz
Five shots to the head cause I'm a Blood nigga
Nuttin brewin but Soo-Woo'in where the fuck I'm from
You lucky if you make it out of Compton, ask Andre Young
Smell the scent of dead bodies ridin down Green Leaf
No peace so don't get caught up with no piece
Fuck Fatburger, we cookin that real beef
Momma's mournin they sons, I'm talkin real grief
Real funerals of them lost juveniles
Tryin to be generals, be missin your dinner now, huh?
Say it's a blessin when you die in ya sleep
Cause the coroner don't need no sheets, capishe?
I'm sayin, stop playin, wrap him up in what he lay in
Fold a nigga arms, now a casket what he pray in
Compton streets raised me
Can't tell my grandma nothin 'bout her baby, you crazy

[Chorus: Tank]
Said she see no evil
She know there's nothin at all
You wanna see tomorrow
You promise not to talk
Say we on our way now
I'ma see you again
And when they ask you questions
You just answer, what happened then?
What happened then?

[Kendrick Lamar]
I live this life at a pace that anyone can go
Know your place and dedicate your role to the faith that you'll die alone
Trace your steps when I do step in the fire of broken bones
And I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sew
I bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a Jag
A cut for my dogs, with a roof full of glass
But still I be feelin like none of my light never casts
Out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
But fuck that, I'm not worried mm, even when discouraged mm
Skirt off makin them hurt off, should've hurt them in a hurry mm
Dirt off all of my fingers, dirt him, all of 'em gone is buried mm
Shirt off when precedure, resuscitation came early
I need you to keep quiet as a mouse
Which is ironic cause rats is what I'm talkin 'bout
I'm hearin the sonics of gunfire, the whispers, the silent cries
Even though we know it's eye for an eye

[Chorus]

[Tank]
I was born a soldier
Ride or die for mine
Tied two tears and a lawyer
Tried to give me love
Heaven can you heal me?
I know that Hell can
So Heaven can you heal me?
I'm only just a man, ohhhhh

[Game]
You wanna go to Compton? Nigga I'll take you there!
Hub City bodies get burnt butt-naked here
Respect the code, a nigga's callin from the pen
Colombian neck-ties on the outside from within
And then, your momma never see you again
Casket to never wake up, plastered in MAC make-up, huh?
Niggaz can't hear you talkin from the sky
And only 5 year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie
Karma catches up to all you head honchos
Two dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco
Shit get real though inside the Fox Hills though
Nigga livin that fast life and get killed slow
Ask Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets
My grandmother's prayers saved you niggaz, I never wanted peace
Los Angeles, I'm the motherfuckin king here
No First 48 cause muh'fuckers don't sing here
Huh?

[Chorus]</pre>

[Chorus]
I done been through things in my life
Feels like too much
I could have broke down and lost my mind
But I'm too strong

[Andre Abella]
I remember being young growing up, we didn't have much
Going to school with no money, eating bagged lunch
Speaking of food inside my cupboards, it was sad but
knowing inside my mother never would abandon
us, and a sob was like the only thing I ever made
Really inside I'm trying hard not to cuss and scream
Wasn't a dream, I was surrounded by a couple fiends
Imagine the team stuck in the middle of amphetamines
Tryna survive the cliche, yeah by any means
Using the wit to get some milk and the rice and beans
Using the money that wasn't green, it was bag-brown
EBT, it was in me but I was damn proud
People was looking down like I was on the first floor
Like I'm looking for charity, I ain't begging, I'm just poor
Plenty and many times I can break and just lose my mind
But I'm strong and I carry on, I will never let it define me

[Chorus: 2X]

[Frank Clark]
Life's been hard, I'm working the garden, more like a fight in the dark
and need to eat but we starving and the lights would go off
I tried to keep it a secret, these things are eating at me
No being Leave It to Beaver, you see it's Tweedlee Dee
Eager to breathe, the heart is beating too fast
and hard to think what I'm seeing when pops is beating my ass
Though it made me a man on both feet, I'm an ox
Staying true to the plan to always do what I love
Could have gave up and ran, it would be never enough
and being less of a man, but damn we right on the cusp
Life in the gutter feels like a knife in the gut
and living righteous and brighter, so know we rising above
To judge a book by its cover would your biggest mistake
I realize like no other, I do believe in my fate
Bad dreams, best believe they gon' fade
and better days are coming my way

[Chorus: 2X]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Good kid, mad city, thirty niggas, thirty semi's
Plenty blunts, plenty Remy out the bottle till it's empty
Full throttle, fast life, Dale Earnhardt sent me
Hope I don't crash when I speed past, God forgive me
I can see my tribulations getting worse
Conversations with my past demons, can I soul search?
Hoping I can find something so defiant I can put a rose on it
Smelling death around the corner, don't you put your nose on it
Wake up on cold mornings thinking bout my life in general
Career criminal, picture that like a centrefold
Only the best of sinners know
how it hurts when you looking to be a saint but the way that you think is pitiful
Times is harder, where's your father?
You never had one, he never did bother
and so your passion is a permanent author
telling stories from the streets, don't let it shorten your sleep
Be strong

[Chorus: 2X]

{*Imagine Dragons harmonizing for 28 seconds*}

[Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up, to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathin' in, the chemicals... {*inhales, exhales*}
I'm breakin' in, and shapin' up
Then checkin' out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse - whoa-ohh

[Chorus: Imagine Dragons]
I'm, wak-in', up - I feel it in my bones
E-nough, to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoooa-ohh-oh, whoooa-ohh, I'm - radioactive, radioactive
Whoooa-ohh-oh, whoooa-ohh, I'm - radioactive, radioactive

[Dan Reynolds]
I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution that I suppose
We'll paint it red to fit right in - whoa-ohh
I'm breakin' in, and shapin' up
Then checkin' out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse - whoa-ohh

[Chorus]

[Dan Reynolds]
All systems go, sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside...

[Kendrick Lamar]
Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that +Forbidden Fruit+ and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds
Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me - DRY SNITCH~!!
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'mma make my mark, even when they start their Martial Law
Even when these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Fuck, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't give a fuck and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, fuck your amenities, I'm gettin' better with time
AHHH~!!

[Chorus]

{*guitar + drum solo to the 4:24 mark*}

[Imagine Dragons]
I'm - radioactive, radioactive

"Code Red"

[Jay Rock]
Motherfucker, this is Watts, California
Gangbang, murder state

"What's up Jay Rock?" Shit, just the same old, same old
Same fiends in the hood chasing the best dope
Project hustling, chasing them pesos
It's a struggle every day man, you know how this shit goes
But my demeanor will never switch, cherry-red Beamer
Gangbanged the fuck out, red rag around the Nina
No doubt, I'm living it
Been claiming the set since the year they found Snoop innocent
Slanging hard rock when the rap game was ran by Timberlands
Deport ya asses back, where my strap?
Let me put a hole in 'em
and what's concealed in the black denim will rock 'em to sleep like I babysit 'em
I seen it all, loyalty, betrayal, envy
My close homie died in my arms
Twelve-hundred project units under the sun
Ain't bout where you're at, it's about where you're from

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to Watts, California
where we ain't scared to run up on ya
You ain't prepared when it go down
You already dead right about now
Welcome to Watts, California
where we ain't scared to run up on ya
If you're prepared when it go down
then you know it's Jay Rock turn now

[Jay Rock]
The homie told me, put your feelings aside
But since I got signed I been feeling the +Vibes+
Niggas play the background and screw they face all day
Wanna walk in my shoes, wanna take my place
So at any given time they might take my life
So I take the .38 when I ride at night
Broad day, no exempt, niggas kill you when the sun is out
Make sure your gun is out or stay inside your mama house
It's that real, you don't feel me yet?
Fine, niggas drop the beat and just let me vent
No mask on, fuck around and kill your whole squad
Be the last person you see before you meet God
Keep the rifle on top of the tripod
Aim hard, if you live your body might need parts
Jay Rock, putting it down for Top Dawg
From the bottom to the top, we shoot straight to the stars

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]

[Outro]
"The has been another tragic incident
 One confirmed death and one in critical condition
 Stay tuned in for more coverage on this story
 This is Keyshona Cole for WTOP News, and I'm signing off"</pre>

Artist: Jay Rock f/ Giddy, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Black Friday
Song:   Diary of a Broke Nigga
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Jay Rock]
Look inside the eyes of a broke nigga, see the stress on his face
Look at his heart, ain't no love in the place
What's on his mind? Murder, money and mayhem
If he don't see a dollar, somebody visiting Satan
He grabbed his gat from under the mattress, he cocked it back
Then grabbed his gloves and a mask, then threw on his hat
Looked in the mirror and said, times is hard
So hard that he got gray hair on his balls, pause
In the ghetto, you destined to fall
That's why it's a must that we ball
That's why he on the corner lurking, waiting for a motherfucker to slip
Soon as he see the chance, he taking a risk
What should you do when this nigga snatch you out of your whip
empty out your pockets, then snatch what's on your neck and your wrist?
Nothing, cause when the gat in your mouth, so speechless
Any false move, then your brain's on the cement
It gets gutter when niggas starving
Niggas will run inside your house, kill you on target, heartless
This is way beyond a cold thriller
This the diary of a broke nigga

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Giddy)
"Pump, pump" Everybody lay down on the ground
Give me whatever you got right now
"Pump, pump" Everybody lay down on the floor
Give me whatever you got, plus more
(When times is hard, and I'm praying for change
 My funds is low, when I need some change, I'ma...)
"Pump, pump" Make sure you hide your goods when I come mister
You're dealing with the diary of a broke nigga

[Jay Rock]
It's been a whole month, he still ain't seen no paper
Nigga losing weight every time that he wake up
Plus, he tired of asking niggas for favors
cause when they get mad, they throw it back in his face
That's foul, flagrant, this nigga been slaving
in the spot all week, still ain't seen no paper
That's fucked up, they say don't bite the hand that feeds you
But if that hand don't feed you, where would that leave you?
Now that the stress come, can't turn back the hands of time
Got him thinking back on what he should have done
First thing on his mind now, get a gun
Shit, you gotta eat, and you got a son
and a daughter, now that's two mouths to feed
And that money seem far, like miles to reach
But it's right there, but his brain cloudy
Life on the wrong road, can't reroute it
Caught that nigga, then showed him what that heater do
If you don't feed your wolves, your wolves eat you
This is way beyond a cold thriller
This the diary of a broke nigga

[Chorus]</pre>

[Intro: Jay Rock]
This shit is fresh out the oven, fresh out the oven

[Jay Rock]
I'm back in this bitch, nigga you know what's up
Stackin' my dividends
Straight out that gutta so you know just what you dealin' with, highly belligerent
But that's way before the liquor hits
Roll that kushy kushy, rub on her goodie goodies
Crush her so good, she all on my timeline now
Lookin' lookin', she tryna sabatoge my thing
Never go brazy when you're deep inside the pink
I'm lowkey like a drug dealer
So don't snitch my nigga, get your chips my nigga
Mind your bid'ness, I minds mine, let's get rich my nigga
Take our family on trips my nigga
But if you try me then your wig I'ma split my nigga
And I ain't tryna kill my own kind
But we always losin' to the wrong place at the wrong time, no lie
And they wonder why us niggas always get high
Spend a thou-wow on it just to get fly
Another thou-wow on it just to get by
Fuck it, only got one life to live
Gotta push it to the limit, do it big like

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
What?! This shit is fresh out the oven
Whip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it
If anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'
Just as long as you thuggin', yeah it's fresh out the oven
Whip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it
If anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'
Just as long as you thuggin'
Big bank rolls, just as long as you thuggin'...
Whip game cold, just as long as you thuggin'

[Jay Rock]
I pull up and park, hop out and swag
Grab the Glock out the trunk, other Glock in the stash
Just a regular nigga, with no chains or nothin'
If I do get some shines, you try to snatch (ba-blam!) there's repercussions (ba-blam!) 
And concussions (ba-blam!)
You know what's after that, end of discussions (man down!)
I came a long way from eatin' free lunches
From Mary County checks to makin' these numbers
Oh Lord, I'm just reminiscin'
Kill the beat, some intervention on some inner vision
I don't know cause I'm just goin' with the flow
Whatever's required, I got it goin' for the low

[Kendrick Lamar] + (Jay Rock)
I, parted ways with my old self, I'm a new man
New face with a new stone and the blue van
Blew weight on a bad day with my loosies
Suitcase full of merchandise, that's my new plan
This my new wave, this my new tan
This my summer days in the tropics by the cool sand
This my shakin' down you niggas' pockets, I don't do friends
(And I don't do trends) Fuck it though, I'll ride with you then!
Bring the troops in (I'll fuck around and let 'em loose then)
We'll give 'em blues then (Oh fuck it, call me Bobby "Blue" Bland)
Aye you a fool man (Ridin' by you, swervin' at the intersection)
(Baby come and get your blessing) Aye she gon' fuck with this erection

[Jay Rock]
I got somethin' good for all these hoes
She gotta want the Betty 'fore I call these hoes
Now if I paid for your dress and the perm
That means you an investment bitch, I'ma need my dough in return

{*static; beat switch*}

[Interlude]
"We reportin' live from the 90059 with my nigga Jay Rock 
and this is WTOP Radio and I'm your host DJ Turn Up
I don't turn down nothin' but my collar
I ain't turnin' down no money and I ain't turnin' down no mothafuckin' fade
Now bitch if you're pushin' up the freak with your orangutan-lookin' ass
Take some advice and bang SZA, ya flat-foot bitch~!"

[SZA]
Itchin' for a climax lastin' past 11:30
Do you got it like that? Do you really got it like that?
Itchin' for a purpose, I can't seem to scratch the surface
I ain't got it like that; do I really got it like that?
You keep talkin' 'bout time, I got none
You can find me where the sun don't never end and the waves don't part
You don't pay enough of my rent, don't start
I got big dreams and you got quick scheme to get rich quickly
And I don't wanna waste another hour
Really need to take another shower - dirty for you

[Jay Rock]
Now this that big shell fishscale
BMX on the ramp with the fishtail
Pegs on the front, we gon' get there
We four deep at a swap meet, don't need a 5th wheel
This bitch steal whoever if situations get real
This that fresh out the bounty, bustin' knuckles
Get buckled if you ever try to knock the hustle
Show your hands, watch how I shuffle (no cuts)
And show you why they hate more niggas than Uncle Ruckus
Rollin' up that +Boondock+, some call it moon rock
Gotta keep that bass in my step, dope in a tube sock
Gotta do what I do to remain on
So all a nigga need is good love when I come home
Cause the baby's gotta eat, baby the rent's been due lately
And I just caught a hot one, I ain't tryna go too crazy, fugazi, not me
Me and my niggas not sweet
Give you thug passion, how you walkin' around knock-kneed
I'm the silver bullet movin' at top speed
Show you how to get it and get away with it scott free</pre>

Song:   Hood Gone Love It
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
Keeping it G ain't nothing
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public
I got the whole block bumping
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public

[Jay Rock]
Na-now-now-now-now-now you know what this is
Tell 'em it's a celebration bitches
with barbecue pits and the mini-bikes
Mini-skirts, Hennessys and the Miller Lites
Domino tables, who got big six?
Where I'm from we do concrete backflips
Flip flop, flip flop, flip flop back
to the ghettos where I bring Hip Hop back
Real niggas love me, they tell me keep it pushing
The only niggas speak from way inside of Central Bookings
County jails and them lock-downs up north
Said I should have it if Scarface passed the torch
That's how they feel Jack, but this more than rap
This that project haircut in a cul-de-sac
This is where Jose front you, them quarters at
Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track, nigga

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
From Compton to Baltimore I'ma kill it, I'll buy a morgue in the minute
The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
The Regal window is tinted, the air conditioner broke
But I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an eskimo, huh?
And I peel off in the midst of getting my thrills off
And I thrive off energy from inner cities that we lost, huh?
I'm putting the ghetto on top of my back
And I live in the back of the jungle, lions, tigers, bears, oh my
Hear the siren, walk up {*gunshots*}, drive-by
Shooters, looters, Federal Fed intruders
Engines on back of scooters, the real can recognize real
and we need to know just who you are, you are in the presence of many presents
Kendrick, the gift for the future, oh yeah I said it
Thug Life, good kid, mad city
Mad respect, representing the Hub right

[Chorus]

[Jay Rock]
The homegirls tell me I'm the shit
I break 'em off so they can buy 'em some outfits
I buy they sons a pack of pampers, some new Jordans
Give 'em the game, school 'em on what's really important
That's how I was raised, the OGs had me
thirteen, fresh off the porch, slanging cabby
But I'm wiser now, showing my young niggas
there's other ways you get them dollars and funds nigga
Coming down in an old school, so cool
Whip like a fireball, call it Goku
You don't know the tribulations that we go through
Put your ears to the speakers, I'ma show you
I paint a picture so perfect
Hear my CD, you see Mona Lisa in person
Courtesy of a hunnit beat
Got my crips and eses at arm reach, one west~!

Song:   King's Dead *
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

* version exclusive to Redemption

[Intro]
Still in the projects
Still in the projects
If you fall, all, all, all
There's no king of the projeeeects

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Miss me with that bullshit (bullshit)
You ain't really wild, you a tourist (a tourist)
I be blackin' out with the purist (the purist)
I made 100 thou' then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I made 500 thou' then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I bought a '87 for the weekend (the weekend)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (what you want)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (what you want)

[Jay Rock]
And it's like that lil' bitch
MVP, I don't get no sleep, no I don't like that lil' bitch
Bust that open, I want that ocean, yeah that bite back lil' bitch
Do it bite back lil' bitch? Need two life jackets lil' bitch
I ain't gon' hold you, I ain't gon' press you, never control you
I ain't gon' front you, keep it 100, I don't know you
Boss like Top Dawg, bossed my life up, crossin' over
Stutter steppin', got a Hall of Fame in all my poster
I've been ready, my whip been ready, my bitch been ready, my clique been ready
My shit's been ready, my check's been ready, my shot's on full, that's armageddon
I got pull, I hope y'all ready, my tank on full, you know unleaded
I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it
My name gon hold up, my team gon hold up, my name gon hold up, my team gon hold up
My shots gon' fire, my team gon' roll up, menage-a-trois, my queen gon' roll up
I hope y'all ready, you know I'm ready, I rain all day, you know confetti
I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, skrrt!

[Future] + (Kendrick) + {Jay Rock}
(Miss me with that bullshit - bullshit)
You're not a gang member, you's a tourist (a tourist)
I be blackin' out, I be blackin' out
Bought an '83 Cutlass for the weekend (for the weekend)
I got a hundred thousand then I freaked it (then I freaked it)
I made 500 thousand then I freaked it (then I freaked it)
I put a Rolls Royce on my wrist, oh yeah
Fuck his baby mama, tryna sneak diss (ahh~!)
I took her to my penthouse then I freaked it (then I freaked it)
I haven't made my mind up, should I keep it? (should I keep it?)
I got big dog status, it ain't no secret
La di da di da; slob on me knob
Pass me some syrup, fuck me in the car
La di da di da, mothafuck the law
Chitty chitty bang, murder everything
{Bitch I'm on a roll and I put that on the gang} (yeah)

Artist: Jay Rock f/ Chantal Kreviazuk, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Pay For It (S)
Song:   Pay For It
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Chorus One: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Ain't no game, I'm takin', ALL you have
And you're gonna pay for it
I don't know if I can, STOP myself
And you're gonna pay for it

[Chorus Two: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Ohhh, you'll never learn
I touch fire, let it burn
This ain't no game, I'm takin', ALL you have
And you're gonna pay for it

[Jay Rock]
It's a heavy load, I stroll on a bumpy road
No jacket when I was cold, becomin' one with my soul
Stand toe-to-toe with my foes, these wolves in sheep clothes
No weapon on me shall prosper, nigga, you better watch it
You playin' with fire, burnin' you slow, hold up
I hear the whispers wishin', it's all cheap voodoo
I keep it cool to keep from goin' cuckoo
With a cal., aimin' at fake smiles and turn them upside down
Came too far for my feet to fail me
Lord, if I'm wrong you can help me now, hold up
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'?
The Devil, he busy, tryna get me everyday in every way
I won't let up, I won't shut up
You can't stop me, you won't knock me, ten-four, now copy
Live almighty, my declaration been written
in hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain, now listen

[Chorus One]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I tell 'em all to hail King Kendrick, resurrectin' my vengeance
Been dissectin' your motormouth 'til I break down the engine
This ain't no warnin' shot, this a relevant henchman
See my opponent then {*poof*} cease your existence
Endin' our friendship, baby, I'd rather die alone
Your diaphragm is dietary, what you eatin' on?
Capture your audience with these words, boy
The Holy Chapel, the Tabernacle, the Book of Matthew and Jesus starin' at you
Take your turn, boy
See it's gon' take a whole LOT of y'all to kill me
See it's gon' take a whole TRIBE of y'all to kill me, I never die
My pedigree apparently only to idolize
Ahead of me is only my future and idle time
Longevity, I gotta get used to makin' you mine
You tellin' me I only get used to livin' if fine
You can never live in my shoes, permanently paid from God~!

[Interlude 2X: Kendrick Lamar]
When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die
But I will never die, my legacy is alive

[Jay Rock]
I die to get it off my chest, push words just like weight
I got to eat 'til it shows on my face
Tragedy turn to triumph, I'm tryin' just to relate
Jumpin' off of them towers, I'm takin' that leap of faith
Playin' at high stakes
Now when I speak, their pupils, they'll dilate, through speakers'll vibrate
Know you feelin' the vibe, that vine couldn't relate
This next clip is long, a son of a gun, big numbers
Do the math, now cover the sum
I come from the slums, we come for the funds like run it
Under the sun where niggas livin' their life blunted
Countin' the ones but truthfully nothin' like hundreds, keep it one hundred
Roadblock in front of me, look, I'm runnin' through it
Stick and move it, sippin' that Hennessy, this my gutter fluid, nothin' to it
What we lost, we gon' make it back
Like it wasn't missin', now listen, you 'bout to pay for that

[Chorus Two]</pre>

Album:  Follow Me Home
Song:   Say Wassup
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
They know I put it down, now they wanna say wassup (hey)
When you see me in your town, say wassup (hey), roll around, say wassup (hey)
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup (hey), that's wassup (hey)
Break it down, that's wassup (hey), blow a pound, that's wassup (hey), heyyy
"All day every day, I be on my 3-0" that's wassup (hey)
"All, all day every day" that's wassup, heyyy
"All day every day, I be on my 3-0" that's wassup (hey)
"All, all day every day" that's wassup, heyyy

[Ab-Soul]
And my taillight broke like a promise homie
This the realest shit I wrote, on my momma homie
My teachers used to call my momma on me
Now I'm a rap star and I can fuck my momma's homies ('Soul!)
Me and ScHoolboy hit the liquor store
Chocolate swisher burn slow, how sweet?
Who got the 'dro? Who tryna chief like Pocahontas daddy?
And I'm off that granddaddy kush, I'm finna start a family

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm ghetto, my Kool-Aid need mo' sugar
Five star suite, you ain't know, sugar? (you ain't know, bitch?)
I'm chilling, bumping Anita Baker
Caked up, they wonder why I don't need a baker
But really though, I just need a hater
So I ask 'em for they number when I see a hater
Ask Obama if I don't know about presidents
Keep them dead motherfuckers resting in my money clip

[Chorus]

[ScHoolboy Q]
Look up in the mirror and my gangsta told me, what it do?
Cap'n Crunch and Top Ramen, all a nigga ever knew
Got a bitch to twist a blunt and pop a nigga collar too
Who that nigga standing over there? That's that nigga Q
What it do? That's wassup, bang this in your Tonka truck
Everybody rocking chucks and pistol packing, that's a must
Sagging and my ass showing mami, and the cops knowing
all I wanna do is smoke a blunt, let it bump

[Jay Rock]
Yeah, I'm looking in the mirror and a nigga say, wassup Rock?
And that nigga looked back at me and said, boy you certified
Took my '87 Regal, put it in a chop shop
Stash spot, .45, run up, you gonna die
Looking for a pretty bitch who can twerk it and throw it back
Nigga diss me, no I ain't missing, I'm throwing shots back
Jay Rock, top cat, and I'm still a Top Dawg
Boxed in that Porsche Box like I'm fighting southpaw

[Chorus]

[Verse Five]
Ab: Uh, and I'm 'Solo, take a photo, blowing dodo in a dojo
KL: We a green light, you a no-go, hey Q, go
SQ: No, Rock go
JR: I'm a Rock though like Barack though, and my eyes low, and I drive slow
    like Paul Wall
SQ: Give it back though, I got y'all
Ab: No, fuck that, I'm a ball hog
KL: No, fuck that, they gon' fall off
SQ: Got a sawed-off
    I'ma hop out, let it all off, hop back in, then I haul off
KL: We situated, we hit the pavement so hard we all got ground to play with
Ab: A challenger is like last year calendars, yup
JR: You're all outdated
KL: We all amazing, you all can hate it, you can live or die, that's your ultimatum
    Married to the game, at the alter wasting, a pound of white rice from the tribe of Asians
SQ: Niggas, they ride for me, bitches, they desire me
    And what's the one thing they hate the most?
JR: Saying bye to me

[Chorus]</pre>

Artist: Jay Rock f/ Ab-Soul, Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q (Black Hippy)
Album:  Black Friday
Song:   Shadow of Death
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Jay Rock]
Yeah, Los Angeles, 'Welcome to the Terrordome'
City of Satan, angels can't even get along
No lie, my town covered in darkness
Hoping that the sun just shine on us
Rolling up the kush, now I'm letting my mind wander
into another place, I ain't tryna go down under
Life is like a race and we all tryna finish it
Shit never fair, strays hitting the innocent
The good die young where I'm from and it's sad to say
that somebody gotta die today
Tomorrow's never promised, but we living for the moment
Nigga, time never stops, it just keeps on going
Crackers just gave my young nigga four life sentences
Twenty-five times four, nigga, do the math
And the hood never have witnesses
cause if we did, then them shots gon' blast

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
As I reflect, I start realising I wanna
Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
This ain't the way my life bout to end
So I'm quick to grab on my pen and
Give 'em something my people sure to feel
Give 'em something that I know is all the way real

[ScHoolboy Q]
Just waking up, mind playing tricks on me
Got the fifth on me, gotta take a risk homie
Was a ball player till the coach pissed on me
Keep it real, I could take you down the list homie
Be a tradition, see these Chucks be a mission
Burner be the fuel to the flame, the key to the ignition
If you banging, be serious
Boys run up in your pad, point-blank, period, moms ain't hearing it
Niggas said cuz {?} got blasted
Oh well, give a shit, shouldn't half-assed it
Only time you with it, when your niggas all tripping
Caught your ass slipping, now I'm stepping up my crip and steady dipping
Riding through the city in lights, living it trife
Wrong intersection, ready to fight
Hopping out with my own agenda, who the contender?
Better hope this motherfucker jam (blahh~!)

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, as I'm hearing the first and second verse
I try to analyse the feeling that's felt in the song
I want to tell Rock and Q to go to church
But that's a hypocrite because I ain't been in so long
I stare at the world from a righteous point of view
and realise a crisis coming
Novocain couldn't numb it, the pain is unbearable times two
Let's rally a team, summon, and school the youth
How you feel about it?

[Ab-Soul]
Man, I feel the same way as you
It hurts my soul, like a needle piercing through the bottom of my shoe
And if you behind bars
Hold your head, pause
And if you in close range with a nigga with a gun in his waste
I pray the intervention is divine
I got a cousin in jail and handful of homies in Heaven
But earlier than expected, what the Hell?

[Chorus]</pre>

Song:   They Say
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Jay Rock]
Growing up I was a knucklehead
Boy you never listen to me, that's what my mama said
I'm from the projects, I ain't never had shit
Me and my older brother, we had to share a mattress
No heat, no lights, had to keep them candles lit
My daddy left me at eight, in and out my life and shit
Gang bangers, dope dealers replaced my father
Neighborhood hustlers taught me to get them dollars
That's when I became a problem, product of my environment
It's hard to grow up to be a doctor or a fireman
when you constantly seeing that G-ride tires screeching
and them shots firing all the time, it happens frequently
The hood inspired him, to be a G
I bled for the game, did it all for the letter B
The big homie gave me the name Jay Rock
This ain't no rap gimmick, this a real life story of Watts living, nigga

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can take, me out the hood
But you can't take the hood out me
And that's the way that it will forever be
And I can't help it, I'm gutter
Why should I change now
when all my life I've been gang banged out?
That project shit run deep in my veins now
And I can't help it
Ooh, my Lord knows that I can't help it

[Jay Rock]
Let me take you on a detour, east side Watts
Niggas who go in projects
Follow me home to my black and white apartments
Police roll through with caution, scared to death
The homies got tats across them
Capital B.H. over they necks, since birth banging the set
Even hoes banging the set
Some ain't, but most is hood rats, they looking for the buck
Them trash cans lay in the street, ghetto technique for drive-bys
For the low them five dollars will get you high
Dice games, YGs, fist fights
Six-fo's, El Co's, G-rides and mini-bikes
Might see a couple of zombies late night
Off what? Off pipe
Membrane dead right, no lie
Something in the bushes, either the AK or the .45, no lie
Raised in the ghetto with rats and roaches
Smokers on porches getting high off yola
It's colder north, but my city's the coldest
Where we ain't promised to see the morning, nigga

[Chorus]

[Jay Rock]
You could take me out the hood, but the hood will never leave me
I'm still banging, I'm still hanging
The only difference is I'm not slanging, nickels and dimes
More like slanging these rap lines
Verses of truth, when I step in the booth
Niggas know I pour my soul for the struggling youth
For that fatherless son who needed love, so he ran with a crew
Grew up before his older brother did, gin and juice
replaced the pain I knew, carrying thangs to school
Them niggas was tripping, I wasn't banging the blue
But they had to respect me, I never ran from who?
Nobody, put my faith in God
It's amazing how I overcame them odds
On my momma, this past year, my life has slightly been revised
But notice I said slightly
cause me being absent from where I came from, that's unlikely nigga

[Chorus]</pre>

{"Cardo got wings"}

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
It's work on the phone
Tell my momma that I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers, I said it's work on the phone
Somebody tell my momma I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers

[Jay Rock]
If that's your real nigga, he gon' slide for you (slide)
If that's your real nigga, he gon' die for you (ride)
You ain't gotta question when it's brackin'
Just point me in the direction when it's action
Day ones in the sandbox, from breakin' through them padlocks
To burners in the stashbox, your whole hood mascots
My whole hood mad Watts - that's gang gang gang
We politic on missions, don't hang hang hang
We got bad bitches too huh, and they blast bitches too huh
And they shoot the fair one too huh, we can take it there too huh
Niggas win some and lose some, just went half on the new drum
Summertime is overdue huh, double back when the news come

[Chorus]

[Jay Rock] + (Kendrick Lamar)
Back door, back door, Eastside we go back door
What you wanna act for? You get what you ask for
Ballin' in the game now, Eastside we go back door
(Eastside, Eastside, Eastside, Eastside, Eastside)
Nothin' is the same now, motherfuck the task force
Came up and I went back, changed up, never did that
If it's taped off, yeah I did that, blew a half a mil', yeah I did that
On the play, girl is you with that? Ten toes on the pavement
Sell your soul and the days end, shacked up like a caveman
Troopers on deck, secure the bag, we plant the flags
So what we on next? What we on next?
Rock bottom from the NGs, hand guns on tenth speed
R.I.P to my dead homies, loyalty is all we need, yeah

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Big money, big booty bitches, man that shit gon' be death of me
Big problems, I must admit it, man that shit gon' be death of me
I pray to a C-note, my momma gave up hope, I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke, I can't stand myself
Big money, big booty bitches, man that shit, heheh... turn me up
Sin City, Sin City, Sin City, Sin City

[Kendrick Lamar]
Big money, big booty bitches, tell the truth nigga, I'm lost without it
Seven figures for a headline, you want some stage time, we can talk about it
Niggas actin' like they be rappin' like nice on the mic, truly doubt it
Go against the kid, y'all don't wanna live, that decision is hella childish
Rose gold for my old hoes, they ain't satisfied then I sit 'em down
10th grade, I gave her all shade but now she got some ass, I wanna hit it now
I don't lease, I just all out feast, I put a blue Caprice on Gary Coleman
Bomb head and some cheese eggs, that's a new raise and a signin' bonus

[Jay Rock]
Fall in this bitch like some good pussy, can't stand myself
So good, she so hood, she a cheesehead, patty melt
GED with some EBTs and some EBD's, that shit was happenin'
She reeled me in with some chicken wings and some collard greens, that shit was brackin'
Just cracked me a new bitch, bust a new nut on her nigga's jersey
My bitch got off at 9:00 so I had to shake her 'round 7:30
105, I'm stompin' fast with these big guns, I'm hella dirty
Get caught with this shit, I ain't comin' home 'til like 2030

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I got big money, big booty bitches, man that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big problems, I must admit it, man that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big dreams, no superstition, man that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
I pray to a C-note, my momma gave up hope, I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke, I can't stand myself
I just might ban myself, I just might - God! 
God!

[Jay Rock - over Chorus]
I'm focused feelin' blessed cause my eyes be the truth
I'm focused feelin' blessed cause my eyes be the truth, hmm

[Ab-Soul]
Mental window blurry as a bitch, still lookin' out it
So much money off the fuckin' books, could write a book about it
Took a minute, no wait a minute, let me, think about it
Bout 10 years, Crips, Bloods, sweat and tears and we, still countin' (hmm)
Had a real thick bitch named Brooklyn, she fucked the, whole squad
Now, every time I land in Brooklyn, they fuck with the, whole squad
Uh, I'm more spiritual than lyrical, I'm similar to, Eli
Why? Cause I'm wearin' black shades and I'm headed west with the, word of God (amen)
Yeah, I think I'm finally ready to talk about it
These niggas just talk about it, homie don't play me for no fool
Poppin' bottles like in enemigos, los dios mio, I'm so cold
Get so deep in that water water, they should call my johnson a harpoon

[Jay Rock]
Feed the needy, don't know graffiti, paint her walls like a, cartoon
Beat the pussy up so bad, send her home with some, war wounds
Loaded off the 'gnac, hit her from the back, goin' 'cross her head, bar stool
Touch her soul 'til I curl her toes then it's time to reload then it's, part two

[ScHoolboy Q]
Hm; damn near 30, still set trippin' cuz, where you're from? I'ma, see about it (hm)
Last year I made 10 million, that's where I've been, yeah I'm, private island (hm)
Smokin' somethin' on, autopilot, got too many cars, I might crash a whip (uh)
New 'Rari pedal barely tappin' nigga, VROOM-VROOM, yeah I'm rich bitch~!
Got two Rollies but one missin', think my daughter flossin', she in, kindergarten
Got one crib worth two cribs and my front lawn, yeah that's, water fountain
You be talkin' boss, sayin' big words like philosophies, man you, weird homie
What it sounds to me that you broke as fuck and your bitch gon' leave and that's, real homie

[Chorus]</pre>

Go and get your money bitch, none of my niggas on some funny shit
I can tell real by who you runnin' with, I'm all in the field, duck huntin' shit
Hit my plug just to re-up and he was like "Boop, here"
Migo knew just what it was, flipped the whole dub and gave it back, "Boop, yeah"
911, no mileage baby, 9 ball but no violence baby
My trigger finger got callus baby, my bare knuckles got talent baby
I'm all in the wind with it, on deuce line, I've been with it
She too fine, I been hit it, crashed two times, I limo-tinted
My new ride, I'm ridin' with the toaster (toaster) 12 better not pull me over (over)
Championship goin' dumb, nothin' to somethin'
I won bitch (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!)

[Chorus]

[Intro: Jay Rock] + (Kendrick Lamar)
Ayy K. Dot (yay yay)
Can we get it how we used to get it like when Top had the red Charger?
Can we get it how we used to get it like when Top had the red Charger?
Can we get it how we used to get it?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Cap on, and I got racks on
Spent four nights in the country I like then take my rich ass back home
Blow so bright, I could make moonlight, see this ain't like your pheromones
Blew one, big gun, baritone, who won? We won, yeah home
We old school like capitol, my old school made doctor note
My old school made hard knock - black on black, my coupe ain't strapped
I ain't ballin' on the hard top, I told y'all to call Top
Now my number call blocked, I don't miss, I call shot
Hol' up, yeah, cap on, and I got racks on (and I got racks on)
And I produced that diesel, I could put Shaq on (I could put Shaq, ayy)
Nigga, your bitch gon' leave you, you ain't got backbone (you ain't got, hol' up)
I don't rely on people, I just go and bread chase, whoa
This so fuckin' dope, I might catch a fed case, whoa
You ain't gettin' money nigga then you dead weight, whoa
Got the drop on 'em, there he go, checkmate, whoa
We go drop on 'em, y'all better play it safe, whoa

[Jay Rock]
Cap on, and I got racks on
Don't be bitter, your dope they reconsider, that shit be stepped on
Eastside Johnny way out that project building I get my rep on
Fuck your feelin, no question bitch, I kill it, I bring that check home
We old school like domino, my old school made lawyers know
My old school a match box - black on black, bad bitch in the back
We ballin' on a hard top, Dot told y'all to call Top
Now my number call blocked, we don't miss, we call shots
Swervin', I pay 'em no mind because I curve 'em
She said I looked way better in person
I told her I do better when I'm workin'
You scared motherfucker? Go to churches

[Kendrick Lamar] + (Jay Rock)
Right back in this bitch, take a flick hoe, what's happenin'? Yeah
We don't politic, money clip, like it's fashion, yeah
Me and Rock go back like, flippin' mattresses
(Me and Dot go back like, knockin' addresses)
Cap on, cap on, drum hold thirty, no add-on
Lil' Man-Man not the one to go bad on, big heat stamp fold out when you lack on
You ain't no man, you a mouse in a rat hole, I hold band, whole stack, that's factual
Called Big Ten on a island bashful (fuck your plan, I'ma burn that castle!)
(Fuck that clan, I'ma burn that task force, it's sick murder when I say go)
(Hoppin' out that van with the black ski mask and a great big burner when I say go)
Man I took my chance in the paint like that, let's see how further it might go
(And it just might hurt you when I go, and my name might curse you when I go, bitch)

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
God we trust
Fear no man but in God we trust
Both palm in hand, prayin' I stay up
I know you try your best but it's not like us, wow
Oh you say you got a bad one? Wow (wow, wow)
I can tell you never had one, wow (wow)
We back to back actin' manie, wow (skrt skrt skrt, wow)
Eastside Johnny goin' stupid, stupid, stupid, wow</pre>

Artist: Jeezy f/ J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Pressure
Song:   American Dream
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

{"Cryin', cryin', cryin'"}

[Intro: Jeezy]
Yeah, what's up? (Hahah! Yeah! What's up?)
Welcome to America baby (uhh)
Home of the brave, American Dream, you know? (yeah, uhh)
Uhh, yeah, yeah, let's go!

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hard-on when I'm countin' up that mula
Scarface, into livin' life like a king
Every day eatin' good with my team, the American Dream
First they said I wouldn't but I knew that I would make it
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grindin' hard with my team, the American Dream

[Jeezy]
You either good or you great, you either real or you fake
That's why I stay spittin' the real because the real ones relate
Y'all must was raised by some haters, you niggas go âhead and hate
F-f-four car garage for the 'Rari, that bitch came with the estate
I swear them streets get so tricky, glad I ain't fall for the bait
So focused and I'm determined, can see that shit in my face
You niggas go 'head and face it, lil' bitch, ain't shit 'bout me basic
Hit a lick on them bitches and went and iced out a bracelet
Never let my flaws and my past come get the best of me
Turn a 250 to a half, I got the recipe
First my president was black now my president is wack
I ain't never goin' broke, what's American in that?

[Chorus]

[J. Cole]
Got money to make, blow out the candles then cut up the cake
Then I put it on plate, I'm runnin' the game, you runnin' in place
Still a youngin' at heart, but mentally bitch I'm 108
Like Pun in the late 90s, my niggas is jugglin' weight
Runnin' from state to state, gun in the waist for safety
I'm on a paper chase, whatever it takes to make me
A millionaire, silly cause how many really get there?
I mean, how many niggas is Jeezy? Y'all make this shit sound so easy
Breezy, turn on the TV, see these niggas that trap on the CD
Meanwhile, back home, my niggas sell crack at the BP
Hopin' one day they can be thee, niggas is there on the screen
Cause that's the American Dream, now here go the thing
Listen, hysterical screams, comin' from mothers that buried their kings
Or the unbearable pain of watchin' 'em walk out with the sheriff in chains
Becomin' a number, they no longer care about the name
White folks been gettin' rich off of cocaine
Through some underhanded methods, I don't got time to explain
Out of fear that I won't reach 'em and since preachin' ain't my thing
I just drop a gem or two within a few verses I sing
For all my real niggas trapped inside the game
You know that already

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
(Yeah yuh) These streets made for ballin'
(Yeah yuh) Ten toes ain't for fallin'
(Yeah yuh) I hear the world callin'
Tell me if you all in (tell me if you all in)
Look-look, I gotta eat
I gotta, make money with, I gotta feast (ay)
I gotta re-ly on what is known to the travelin' man
Set his own, got my Bible and my rifle in my hand, oh yeah
I gotta eat
I gotta, make money with, I gotta feast
I gotta re-ly on what is known to the travelin' man
Set his own, got my Bible and my rifle in my hand, oh yeah</pre>

Artist: Jidenna f/ Kendrick Lamar 
Album:  Wondaland Presents: The Eephus
Song:   Classic Man (Remix)
Typed by: Cedmaster3K 

[Kendrick Lamar] + (Jidenna)
I'm the only nigga doin' it
You other niggas ruined it, I'm +2 Legit+, go Hammer with the foolishness
My nana said my grammar can maneuver this industry
Until I'm stupid rich and now I'm stupid rich, ahh!
(Even if she go away) Woo woo woo!
(Even if she go away)
Assumin' this is what they humor is, "To Pimp a Butterfly" my newest shit
In fact the rumor is the way I proven it

[Chorus: Jidenna]
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean
I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G
I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street 
elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah baby, I'm a classic man

[Jidenna]
I burn through the hood like "Whoa"
When everybody feelin' so cold
I'm cool like Nat King Cole 
And niggas get a bit of my glow
I got, charm like a leprechaun, mummafunka
Now y'all fuckin' with the wrong mummafunka
Chief be like a don, mummafunka
And we don't live by the law, mummafunka 
Even if she go away, even if she go away
Even if she go away, even if she go away

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
(Classic man) That's on my mama though
I got piranha flow, fuckin' up your designer clothes
(Casket man) Where be your rapper's angle?
Bunch of subliminal bitches, I'd rather fingerbang 'em
Whoa kemosabe, pray to God nobody try me
Catch a body over nothin', Top couldn't even stop me
I got key to my city, I got key to California
I might legalize your homicide and mourn marijuana
Let my daddy smoke his weed, only thing they keep on Philly
I ain't got no jewelry on me bitch, I got the jewelry in me
Aw shit, let me talk my shit, I always been the shit
This ain't overnight, they love me now like they loved me then
I know what I like, I eat the pussy for my nourishment
I know how to cherish it, I know how to decorate your wall and further furnish it
I'ma burn your shit down, this is what the furnace is
I'ma turn your shit around with some friendly services
Ain't no nervousness like I'm ratchet or conservative
And that's affirmative
All I do is lay up and face up my big bills and pay stub
Got no chill for fake ones like fo'real, they say I'm 

[Chorus]

[Jidenna]
Keep my gloves dirty but my hands clean
Gotta keep the business in the family
Breadwinner fillin' up the pantry
Now my niggas slang cane like a dandy
I tell you how it go
You pull out rubber bands, I pull out an envelope
The ladies on my elbow ain't for the show
Every madame on my team is a top general, ohh
Got to be ready for war, war
Should they get into my door, door
Get 'em, we'll get 'em, I know that we'll get 'em
Cause I lived through this shit before, ohh

[Chorus]

[Outro: Jidenna]
I'm a classic man
(Even if she go away, even if she go away)
I'm a classic man 
(Even if she go away, even if she go away)
I'm a classic man
Old-fashioned man, I'm a classic man</pre>

Artist: Kid Cudi f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Indicud
Song:   Solo Dolo Part II
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I don't need, I don't need nobody
Please shut the front door and walk right in
In the land of the man who rock it hard for them
Super Solo Dolo attack, run into that
If you'd like to know, yes, I am on acid
Who could it be? K-I-D
Searching all day in the streets for DMT
Don't sip it, though - it couldn't answer
Drip, drip all day - bumpin' MGMT, homie
Watch who you hate on, fam', without the facts
Sad niggaz back in the hood bumpin' Ratatat
To me it was a dream, a fiend to understand that
You never seen a nigga like me?
I just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth
Cause people talk shit before knowing what I'm about
But for sure these Cleveland boys is ill
But pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real, it's such a trip
Hoes around the globe, I'm known to have a fet'
I don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips
Me and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber jabber
Mmm, you almost got me, but sucker I'm not a sucker
Better get on back
You pussy motherfuckers get the Will Smith smack
And I am not a fronter, better look up the facts
The world know what it be:
Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo - see me and repeat it

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 other nuns
God blessed my tongue, God need it for life
Awkward like car rides, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I really want it - I need it
Break bread - or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out "little Johnny is dead!"
You wish me well, I wish you Hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
What's the definition of water?
Sherm sticks, simply got 'em everywhere you caught us
Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
My son heard it, probably look at you as his father
I'm proud of myself in a bad way
Halfway house, tell that to me halfway
I'm passin' out, ass whoopin'
Your ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you
They couldn't

[Chorus]</pre>

Artist: Lil Wayne f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Tha Carter V
Song:   Mona Lisa
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a story to tell
You know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I see, niggaz, in this, bitch
Stuntin, poppin, bottles
Gettin, drunk, with these, bitches
And when they leave they get followed
Fall a-sleep, with that, bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up she help you try to find it, I love it
I be with bitches, that be with bitches
That be with niggaz with riches
I tell her "Get 'em," she say "I got you"
I say "No bitch, I say get 'em" (huh)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AK's
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim

[Lil Wayne]
Now you, feelin so silly
I smoke +Color Purple+, I'm up in here feelin like Celie
Ooh, nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli
Ooh, you can get snaked, you can get faked
out by the bitch that you feelin
Cause you, thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you, tell her yo' business, she tell me yo' business
You tell that bitch what you feelin
All of the beans you be spillin
To you she lie through her teeth cavities, fillings
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home, and take the specifics
And meanwhile the bitch is on vacation with him
so she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you're checkin
Then your first thought is to start second-guessin
She say "What's wrong?" He say "Nothin, keep restin"
She say "What's missin?" "How you know somethin missin?"
He scratch his head, she say "Get back in bed"
Then she gave him some head, boy you can't trust them bitches
And then she say ooh

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I see, niggaz, in this, bitch
Stuntin, poppin, bottles
Gettin, drunk, with these, bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches, that know the bitches
That's with the niggaz we followin
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona, Lisa
Long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, "Ooh Daddy, let's go to your place"
And if he say yeah, then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share

[Lil Wayne]
I, know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already knowin
And then I call Liz and she say he comin over
I say "Good girl, just remember what I told you"
She gave me the salute, I say "Girl, you're a soldier!"
We're waitin outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissin so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
Nigga turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin hands up
Liz, that's enough, you could put your hands down
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you Daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh!
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me nigga
but think for me nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me nigga
She slip somethin in it, now thank for me nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa out the frame on these niggaz
Pussy got you out of character nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
We have yo' attention
And now you're lookin down a barrel though nigga
Now she lookin for her pantyhose nigga
We just lookin for the casserole nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though nigga
Mona...

[Kendrick Lamar] + (Lil Wayne)
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
and a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin with the Laker on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin at 'em, both poppin up and take a picture
Uh, probably on a internet blog
In a minute he gon' be admittin that he love her on his mother
Man he wanna meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona, Lisa) Pussy good enough
it got him sinnin in the walls
And he diggin in it like he livin in it
Make a new religion with it, man the nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird, when she asked him
did he wanna make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fuck, jumped in the back seat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a Pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me!
Better yet I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'bout no motherfuckin double standard, acting
Fuckin on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty!
Matter fact, bitch gimme yo' phone! {No!}
You fuckin with Wayne's? {No!} Bitch, gimme yo' phone!
{*BZZT*} {No! Let me, let me take this call real quick}
{*BZZT*} {"Like a lollipop"} He on your fuckin ringtone?!
Is that the shit that you do?
Touchin yourself, lookin at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge her
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber, I'm plannin on aimin
Goddamn it, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killin that pussy, I'm killin myself!

[Outro: Lil Wayne] + (Kendrick Lamar)
She say, ooh Daddy ooh (ooh, ooh) Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (ooh, ooh) Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion (ooh, ooh) Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah</pre>

--- YOLO ---
Artist: The Lonely Island f/ Adam Levine, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  YOLO (S)
Song:   YOLO
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Adam Levine]
YOLO

[Andy Samberg]
YOLO, you only live once
The battle cry of a generation
This life is a precious gift
So don't get too crazy - it's not worth the risk

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
So don't be dumb
Don't trust anyone
Cause you only live once

[Akiva Schaffer]
Ughh~! You only live once, that's the motto
So take a chill pill ease off the throttle

[Jorma Taccone]
Never go to loud clubs cause it's bad for your ears
Your friends'll all be sorry when they can't hear

[Andy Samberg]
And stay the hell away from drugs cause they not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard like a beagle

[Akiva Schaffer]
Cause you should never trust a bank, they've been known to fail
And never travel by car, a bus, boat or by rail

[Jorma Taccone]
And don't travel by plane, and don't travel at all
Built a bomb shelter basement with titanium walls

[Andy Samberg]
And wear titanium suits in case pianos fall on ya
And never go in saunas cause they're crawlin with piranhas

[Akiva Schaffer]
And never take the stairs cause they're often unsafe
You only live once, don't let it go to waste

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
So hold off on the fun
Cook your meat 'til it's done
Cause you only live once

[Jorma Taccone]
Yeah~! And here's another piece of ad-vice
Stay away from kids, cause their hair is filled with mad lice

[Andy Samberg]
There's no such thing as too much Purell
This a cautionary tale word to George Orwell

[Akiva Schaffer]
So don't 198-4orce any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt and triple lock it

[Jorma Taccone]
Then hire a taster; make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy then destroy him

[Andy Samberg]
No blankets or pajamas, they can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture - killing machines!

[Akiva Schaffer]
Board your windows up; the sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straightjacket so you're safe from yourself

[Kendrick Lamar]
Mhmmm; take no chances (no chances) stop freelancin (right now)
Invest in your future don't dilute your finances (uh-huh)
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?) Four point two percent
Thirty year mortgage, that's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it don't forge it on your last bill
Rentint is for suckers right now
A dependable savings and you'll retire with money in your account
Beast!!

[All]
YOLO, say no no
Isolate yourself
and just roll solo
Be care-folo
You oughta look out
also stands for YOLO

[Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue
Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside cause you don't want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky

[Andy Samberg]
You oughta look out!

Artist: Mac Miller f/ Kendrick Lamar, Iman Omari
Album:  Macadelic (Mixtape)
Song:   Fight the Feeling
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Mac Miller - Verse 1]
So watch 'em do the macarena somewhere out in Pasadena
Love the drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waste of the space that you take up
Living, this time around I'm not kidding
I had an intuition about these women in suspicion
Got me looking at shit different
How a man in my position can start slipping down these slopes
Cuz its all just (downhill from now)
As a kid I didn't learn that but (now I might)
When you were young and you were just tryna live your life and have some fun
In the world when you have yet to see how evil its become
Its hard to have a dream when you're deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep 'em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
Sometimes I be feeling like a needle to these young kids
You had the world you 'bout to leave it to these young kids
And we gon' show you what the love is

[Chorus - Iman Omari]
Stay high, go for what you know?
Let it in your mental
And don't ever let it go
(it won't stop)
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
(it won't stop)
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

[Mac Miller - Verse 2]
And I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there aint too many times its me, myself and Irene
We stay smoking through the night
Wake up do some Tai Chi
Homie cant you see I'm chilling, please don't fuck up my chi
Yeh my jacket Y3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money kinda stinks of satisfaction
Fell asleep in Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Balling like I'm Jordan but I'm fresh as Mars blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on an idea we never can agree
They tell you what you know but its better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be
Still I tell 'em
Fuck what you know, I'm feeling comfortable
Just continue living life cuz enough of 'em don't
You spend your days counting every single penny, mane
Start now cuz we coming for you anyways

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar - Verse 3]
Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make up
Wrap this much make up off my bitch soon as she yawning
Take up, hours upon days just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it, even if your ears was pierced with
Beats by Dre, I mean
The sun is slowly falling
We all surely should die eventually
So whats your calling?
Oh, you left your phone behind,
Identity, crisis breaks mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and devil said you owe 10%
Sold your soul
I know sold your soul and get hopeless
My focus stay ready opened or close in that float in the open
Of oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme
Or choking or soaking up game
I'm hoping you picked the second one
Change the emotion of jealousy that your holding
You're telling me that your golden but really cubic zirconian
Let me see
I break you down like a pound of fire whenever your tactics are mighty clever
But even if you're Mayweather you

[Chorus]</pre>

Typed by: Cedmaster3K
 
[Intro: Mac Miller]
La la la la la, la la la la (go play that shit boy! Yeah)
La la la la la, la la la la (don't be afraid boy)
La la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la - open your legs
 
[Kendrick Lamar]
Say yeah, share
Say yeah, share
Say yeah...
 
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Hearts on my timeline
Bullet to your rose then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty, have no guideline
One day, four times
You don't mind that I don't care (pleasure, pleasure...)
God is fair (pleasure, pleasure...)
 
[over Chorus]
Your divinity has, turned me into a sinner
And your beauty, can even make Hell have a winter
 
[Mac Miller]
Yeah, and a freak mind is divine so we fuck from behind
On these sides, between thighs, I eat up
Why do, why do anything but trust - myself?
Tried to give her up but she fuck so well
Man that bitch so cold, man that bitch so cold
I'ma take my time, I'ma hit that slow
Cause I ain't in a rush, young girl
You're the only thing for me in this fucked up world
And do you believe in love?
Hold on tight when demons come
It'll be alright, no need to run
Stay with me tonight, we'll see the sun
And when we wake up early, we'll still be young
I never felt this free before, I need you more than keys and doors
I need you sleepin' next to me
The blanket sheets, I'll take them all and keep you warm
Yeah, and I teach her that we were the creatures of love
You be the leader, I could be Julius Caesar
When I'm pullin' up in the Beamer
The beats in the trunk, all the freaks wanna (fuck~!)
 
[Chorus]
 
[Mac Miller]
I need to feel your touch
(You shy) You don't reveal too much
(No lies) Don't hide yourself at all
(With you) I just can't help but fall
(It's true) And I'll try everything
(Girl you're) My sexy nasty, thing
She been gettin' faded all the time
Flap your wings
I been gettin' stoned all week
It make me go too deep
Girl you so lo-ne-ly
Will you come home with me?
Just take your clothes off babe
Know that we been talkin' on the phone all day
I love it when you tell me that you don't behave
Tell me when and where, I bet I won't be late
All I really wanna do is procreate
I'm a Superman, you'll be my Lois Lane
Know you late for work, you stayin' home today
We gon' keep on goin' 'til our bones both break, it's the grown folk way
Yeah
 
[Chorus]
 
{*piano interlude plays on for 1 minute and 33 seconds*}
 
[Outro: Mac Miller's grandmother]
Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair
with my husband, and the wonderful ways that we were able
to understand each other, and find out about each other
We, got to know each other little by little, living very close
in the same, building, and he would help me, with things
and I would, see him and think "What a cute guy" (yeah yeah)
and he was a cute guy
And it was just little by little, we got to know, just to say hello
One day I invited him to a party, and I had heard so much about him
People respected him and he was good to everybody
He knew the people he worked with, all adored him
And it was something so important, the respect that, you have for somebody
For me, was the most important
Being attracted to him and being, finding people respected him
and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed
how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect
and see his feelings and, understand his feelings ahead of time
So it was so very easy to be together
and look forward to being together, and our, love affair just blossomed
the more we saw each other
and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other
After a short period of time we became engaged
and had a very small intimate, wedding with just family and very close friends
The friends we continued to have for the rest of our life
And then came, two adorable little boys
And, my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys
And I feel, I just gave him a wonderful life
A good marriage, and a wonderful family
And I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too
And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other</pre>

Song:   Do it Again
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
Every day I try to escape, the realities of this world
So I tell a disc jockey press play, while I press up on a girl
In the midst of the smoke in the air, the reflection of lights that glare
She'll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight, I might have to stare
And that's power steering, a power trip you see in my appearance
A pile of hundreds, all on a prowl like vampires in a darkest dungeon
Speakers bumping, drinks is pouring, we in the house, we paid the mortgage
Tyrannosaurus, that's real big, pop my collar, pop that lid, uh

[Chorus: Terrace Martin]
Flashing lights, model types, vixens show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, heads is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually, we'll do this till the sun come up, the sun
We'll do this till the sun come up, the sun
Smoke like this till the sun come up, the sun
We'll do this till the moon is dropping, daybreak watching
Then do it again

[Wiz Khalifa]
Some people stay home and sleep, me? I go out at night
All seven days of the week, I live the party life
I got my dogs with me, you can bring some of your friends
We going hard till the sun come up and do it again
I got a drink in my hand, they playing my favorite song
This girl that's dancing on me ain't got no panties on
And she gon' come back to my hotel, don't tell
anyone about us, said I'm here to party all night

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Come to my section (to my section), and down some of this liquor (liquor)
Then tell me what it hit for (hit for)
Gon' be some things I don't remember ('member)
So take some camera phone pictures

[Kendrick Lamar]
Come to my section (to my section), and down some of this liquor (liquor)
Then tell me what it hit for (hit for)
Gon' be some things I don't remember ('member)
So take some camera phone pictures

Song:   Reasons for Seasons
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Terrace Martin]
Tuh, it's big T.M. leaning off the Seagreens
Eyes bloodshot, look at 'em and you'll see him
Now who we've become but his mother's son?
The same one who avoided guns and picked up the drums
Had you marching to a different beat, stood you on your feet
I looked out, helped you off the streets
I gave you advice to heed, a new life to lead
In return, you took my kindness for weak
When I was at my lowest, truest colors started showing
Niggas I called friends wasn't answering they phone then
Cuh, that's when Quik' words rang true
Be careful who you hand your celebrity to
Uh, didn't get it till that very instant
Since then, between me and them I put a little distance
Niggas so lame for saying bro, it's a shame
Disloyal like a hoe, sold you soul for this game
and you still broke nigga

[Chorus: Neka Brown]
Sometimes people go as quick as they come
They say that there's nothing new under the sun
Cause time reveals all the reasons
Things change in life, just like seasons

[Kendrick Lamar]
Little Kendrick from the Hub
Can show you that my motive's always been to give you love
I'm putting out good music in return to build a buzz
that's bigger than life itself, or some bubble kush plug
Won't you look the mirror? You see a pair of eyes that's quite similar to mines
and if you do that shit should scare ya
Baby brother of Compton tryna the accomplish the impossible
with obstacles at my daily grinding, ohh no
Here come the critics, but not from the magazines, I mean
the blocks that be so-called mad at me, they're mean
As soon as success is in my favor
They'll try to break down my character, like I ain't from their heritage
Quite frankly, it'll hurt my soul to hear a nigga that I know
talking bad and tryna play me
Like we ain't had pellet gun fights, falling off of minibikes
In a Buick bumping Clipse with no AC, why would you shame me?

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Terrace Martin]
Yeah, mm, so I was driving home last night on the 1-0-1 freeway
and I look up, and there's a sign that says 'Love your friends and love your family'
And I thought to myself, why do we use these words so loose?
Love, friends and family
I mean, if love is involved, why do friends and family hurt us?
And why do we hurt them?
It's kind of like we all forgot the true definition of love to begin with
Tuh, the one thing I do know, I nor you can be accountable for what somebody else does to us
We can only be accountable for what we do to them
So instead of saying that's my friend, that's my family, and it's love
Huh, I'ma say this to y'all

[Neka Brown]
So many words we say ain't really
What are we really saying?
People never change
Truth will be the same</pre>

Song:   Triangle Ship
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Baby, I wanna.. I wanna get you to understand
I love you.. and I love her too
..But that may be too much for you to deal with
so I wrote a song about it, you wanna hear it?
Well, here it go

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
My life is Mardi Gras and she's the life of the party, y'all
It's like "Ring Around the Rosie", when I came around they chose me
And I make 'em feel famous, famous, FAMOUS, famous
Winner's circle, the square don't fit
And I'm caught up in a triangle ship, now
Livin life in a triangle ship, now now
And I'm caught up in a triangle ship, now
Livin life in a triangle ship, now now
And I'm caught up in a triangle ship, now

[Terrace Martin]
Yeah, I'm caught up in the middle of this love thang
I keep tryin to escape the ball and chain
My main dame holds me down for the winner season
My side piece just a winner, that's for many reasons
Insecurities inside of myself
have me not be able to picture you with nobody else, heh
I'm caught up between two beautiful women
who both cook, clean, and play they position
It's like, I know I'm wrong but I, can't seem to get it right
Process of elimination, hell of a decision to make
Take two (take two) and add me
Never knew a real commitment would ever involve three
The one, she got a temper, always make sure I'm fed
The other one, she leaves me lonely cause she's focused on the bread
Yeah, can't a man ever be so lucky
I guess that's why these women don't trust me, a 3ChordFold

[Chorus]

[Terrace Martin]
It's hard bein a star of a plot when
(Livin life) Love and lust at the same time, goddamn
So I doubled up, put five on they gotten
Gambled with they hearts, had the ball and I dropped it
To leave'll be the death of me, dearly departed
Don't know how I got by bein partially honest
A thin line between love and hate, yeah I crossed it
Wait~! Love is no guarantee, I got options
Fate, is me and her (me and her), it's me and she (me and she)
Multiple choices, not A and B
A test I was destined to fail fo' sho, boy
Rather be stingy than see you huggin on ol' boy
Oh boy, I'm just a man, with a lotta love to give
And I hope you understand, it was never my intent
to mislead me to of you, but it is what it is
Cupid tried to aim straight but I guess Cupid missed - 3ChordFold

Album:  Dreamchasers 2
Song:   A1 Everything
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Meek Mill]
See, I'm an A1 type of guy
I crush A1 hoes (true)
Rock A1 clothes (true)
Drive A1 whips (true)
and still pour A1 sauce on my shit
Huh, I come from the bottom

Huh, crushing all these hoes, rocking all this ice
Selling all these Os, nigga, I done did that twice
So I'm just riding round in my Rolls, bout to get on my bike
just to touchdown in my hood, and I put that on my life
I'm like, yeah nigga, I'm there nigga, I ball hard all year nigga
My diamonds all clear nigga, smack my chain, you dead nigga
I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what you thought
But all my dogs they murk, and all my dogs go hard, fuck that
My new young chick look exactly like Rihanna
Ass like Nicki, but she yellow like Madonna
I take her to the mall, buy her all type of designers
YSL, fly Chanel, all that Dolce & Gabbana
I jump right back like thirty-six, lean hard when I turn the whip
If I ain't have my rap deal, then I'd still be serving bricks
I kill a pussy, I murder shit, homicide on shorty
My gold Role' cost sixty racks and my rose gold cost forty

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I get A1 money, I'm an A1 nigga
Got an A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches
I just bought me a Rollie, you can skate on nigga
If they don't love it, they hate it, well get your hate on nigga
Cause I got A1 everything, A1 everything
A1 everything, I get A1 everything
I got A1 credit, A1 hoes
I drive A1 whips and I rock A1 clothes, I'm gone

[Kendrick Lamar]
Pray to God I washed my hand, but I'll be damned
2012, one-hundred racks to Uncle Sam
A twenty-four year old millionaire
Don't read the contract 'less a mill in there
A1 credit, park my car bow-legged
I got a bus full of bitches, I call it Jerome Bettis
I grab my dick in the picture, your hoe be cropping the image
I'll let you scrape off the dishes, we eating nigga, I'll finish
and come right back, hope you insomniac
Sleep on me if you wanna take a dirt nap
Bitch I'm talking ca-ca-ca-ca, then more ca-ca-ca-ca
Hit your roof until I pop your top up, then more ca-ca-ca-ca till I know I got ya
Balling like I'm balding, then I see Jordan in the mirror
Nigga that's flawless VVS, said CC text me what you wearing
Putting my all inside your bitch, I grip her hips, that's power steering
Bout to hydroplane when I board that plane, I land inside the building

[Chorus: Meek Mill]</pre>

Artist: Mike Will Made-It f/ Future, Kendrick Lamar, Lil Wayne
Album:  Buy the World (S)
Song:   Buy the World
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Future]
Hey hey hey, na na na
Tell me, what you think we hustle for?
I just wanna buy the world
Do the impossible
Sing it with me now, na na na
What you think we out here working' for?
I just wanna buy the world
Do the impossible
Hey hey hey

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Bought a Benz for my baddest bitch
And let my niggas drive that motherfucker
I swear that court won't commendamize a motherfucker
Pray for us cause we be in and out that mothafucker
Lord, help us Lord, my bitch is beautiful, Helen of Troy
Just like assume I get ass from a star
I flip the script when they cast for the part
You ain't talking to me if you ain't talking money my nigga
Strength in numbers my nigga
And I'm number one like my muscles got bigger
Like my puzzles got figured
I spoil my kids, they so stubborn, my nigga
This is how shit is supposed to be, dawg
Rollie on my wrist and around my neck
I got a chain of command and a food chain on
Shoutout my dog lookin' at the four walls
Shoutout Candace for acceptin' my calls
Impossible ain't impossible at all
Tunechi

[Chorus: Future]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga do that shit, nigga done that shit
Nigga any problem bet I overcome that shit
Twenty gold bottles I'm a drink on that shit
Twenty songs that I'm on number one that shit
My name gon' ring and my team gon' win
I shot a nigga once and I'd do that shit again
Put your hands on a Bible stealing candy at a store
To a black homicidal it's the same damn sin
Drop down, give me three points ho
K. Dot, give it to it how you want ho
I'm a show you what this West side about
I'm a pull up in a 'Rari at your grandmama's house, hey now
She got a nigga name in her mouth, hey now
T-O to M-O to ammo, I mean
My MO is zero, see commas, I promise
Now go tell your mama this dick ain't for free
This dick ain't, this dick ain't
This dick ain't, this dick ain't
This dick ain't for free
Touch that, I need cash back, transaction
I bust back in a all black Grand National
Hoodrats in the project if you ask 'em
They wanna buy the world, 10 racks on they taxes
Holiday cheers, tell 'em get checks with a bottle to the neck
Nigga get it how you live

[Chorus: Future & Lil Wayne]

[Outro x2: Kendrick Lamar & Kids]
I say hol up (hey!)
I just wanna ball like them grown ups (hey!)
Tell em catch me if they can
I switch gears then switch lanes
You know just what my mind's on these days
Keep singin' with me</pre>

Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Wop {"EarDrummers"}
Woo! {"Mike WiLL Made-It"}
Sremm 

[Slim Jxmmi]
Yeah, gi-gimme some space
Two styrofoam cups, a pint of some drank
I'm the type of nigga that you meet at the bank (rich nigga)
Grade A bitches treatin' me like a saint
This money doin' somethin' to my brain (my brain)
This money doin' somethin' to my ego (my ego)
This drank got me talkin' like Z-Ro
These pills got me feelin' like Neo (wavy)
And this freak in my ear tryna go (skrrt)
I-I'll turn your crib to a hoe house (huh)
I'm a rockstar, drank 'til I pass out (leggo)
Drank 'til I motherfuckin' pass out (drank)
Drank, drank 'til I motherfuckin'

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Holdin' onto na-na-now
Hopin' they come to life
Cause underneath the stairs is where we
poured our first perfect pints

[Swae Lee]
Really wanna know
Hopin' they come to life
Cause right there on the stairs is where
we poured our first perfect pints

[Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci!
I'm in the trap saran wrappin' with the Vaseline
You know the clean lean jump like trampoline
Always vert with the skrrt, rims tangerine
I fell asleep and +Had a Dream+ ridin' on M.L. King
Two pinky rings, two pints of lean
Two cups, too turnt, two hoes, one me
They were screamin' "Free Gucci" but now that Guwop's free
Blue cheese, no ranch, hunduns on me
Thirty cars deep, it's like a circus with me
Rae Sremmurd, Gucci Mane, it sounds perfect to me
Now I'm back on top like I'm 'posed to be
But I done poured so many pints, that shit got old to me 
Wop

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Kung Fu Kenny, look look

Who the fuck you talkin' to? You mainey (you mainey)
Salute me when I'm walkin' through, you ain't me (you ain't me)
Everything I do is with the extras (extras)
Flip me couple million for investments
And my hood love me unconditional
Your hood love you cause you on the instrumental though
This rap shit crazy, need the woosah
They screamin' "Compton", must be two sides~!
R.I.P. to Shawty Lo, yeah B. Dot know I'm flexin'
V.I.P my barrio, 200 on the guest list
I don't like to sugarcoat or politic with yes men
I like me a bougie hoe from Normandie and Western
2017 onto bigger things (bigger things)
I got a smaller team, got a bigger ring (bigger ring)
Everybody a Crip 'til they black and blue
Everybody a Blood 'til they hemorrhaging
Ah man, Mike WiLL Made-It
Two back-to-back Spurs, me and Mike WiLL made it
Double park on the curb, I can drive but I'm lazy
Half a pint, whole pint, gassed up, crazy, ayy

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Holdin' onto memories
Tossin', turnin' all night (oh yea, yeah yeah)
Leavin' would be wise, but you know where my heart lies
I be rollin' every time that I arrive</pre>

It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine
We're gonna up and up this life
Til' we go down on our luck
It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine
Gonna up and up this life

Liftin' up, liftin' up, liftin' up
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
Let's, wake them up, wake them up
To the sound, yeah

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
They tell you pull over, tell you get out the car
(Something says) Don't do it, don't don't do it!
(Something says) Don't do it, don't don't do it!
(Something says) Don't do it, don't don't do it!
They wanna see your hands, tell you hold up your arms

(Something says) Don't do it, don't don't do it!

[Pharrell Williams]

Reachin' for your keys (yeah) wait, is that your phone? (Yeah)
Got a TBI (yeah - uh, uh, uh, huh)
Wait, is that police? (Uh-huh) get out for what? (Yeah)

[Kendrick Lamar]
You better duck, run fast from the mania
Don't stare, don't laugh at the media
Brake free, press gas when it enter ya'
Don't let it go bad when he ante up
Highway, get out the way
Black man, do your great escape
Pac-man wanna prosecute you
Raise your hand up and they'll shoot ya'
Face off, face off Adolf
Hitler, grandkids slayed off
Niggas, same rules, same chalk
Different, decade, same law
Keep focus
You wanna get caught with your eyes open
You wanna stay clear of the prognosis
Pride provoked him, watch demotion, watch em' close enough
Don't let the holster break or roast ya
Rollercoaster ride that bitch
Soon or later sides gon' switch
You know Johnny got that itch
How, many, more of, us
gotta, see the, coro-ner?
Slain, by the, same, badge
Stop, wait, brake, FAST~!!

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
... Don't do it, don't don't do it!
Don't do it, don't don't do it!
Don't do it, don't don't do it!
... Don't do it, don't don't do it!
Don't do it, don't don't do it!
Don't do it, don't don't do it!</pre>

Yeah, all my young niggas
All my dumb niggas, dumb, dumb
Yeah, woo! Yeah (ayy-aiyyo aiyyo)
Yeah, all my young niggas (ayyy)
All my dumb niggas, dumb, dumb (ayy-aiyyo aiyyo)
Call up blood one time, woo! (ayyy)

Ayy-aiyyo aiyyo (woo!) ayyy (uhh)
Ayy-aiyyo aiyyo (woo!) ayyy (uhh)
Ayy-aiyyo aiyyo (woo!) ayyy (uhh)
Floatation device, ayyy
Elevate your life, ayyy
We with ceiling lights, ayyy
Sippin' from the kite, ayyy

[Pharrell]
We in love at the rally (hey!)
Thought they had to add the clothes (yeah)
Tonight we unify society (hey!)
All my sisters and my bros (yeah)
Against the wind, they gon' shoot us (hey!)
Regardless which way it blows (yeah)
In the moon like we're Venus (hey!)
Kites like UFOs (yeah)
Nigga hold the door
(Nigga hold the door, nigga hold the door, nigga hold the door)
What you tryna close it for?
(Tryna close it for, tryna close it for, tryna close it for)
Nigga hold the door
(Nigga hold the door, nigga hold the door, nigga hold the door)
There's room for so many more
(Room for so many more, room for so many more, room for so many more)
Hey, hey, hey!

Wake up in the morning, don't know if you're comin' back
When we do the moshin', we make sense if we was done
Everybody need space, okay
If you got the light inside, you know you need to black
If you wanna shine way out
If you wanna shine way out
Way, way, way out
If you wanna bring the day out~!

[Kendrick Lamar] + (Pharrell) + {both}
Kites on my radar
Life in my palms, we unite through the chaos - only for the purist!
Tell them to obey ours
My cerebellum threw a rebellion from AR's - room for the boom stick!
The day I have a J.R.
I tell him the worth of God only and quit his day job - motherfuck the bullshit!
Radio never play ours
This revolution ain't televised with prayer
Jumpin' over borders
Ain't no ruler for restrictions, ain't no police to deport us
Ain't no summers for our sons, ain't no dealings for our daughters
Every prosecution hung, save the verdict for the lawyers
Illuminate the corner
Celebrate humanity and scream back at me in the morning
Every field in Mississippi, every street in California
Know the devil is a liar, it's the time to be anointed, ahh!
(Truckin' to a stream, disconnected to a dream)
Head bussin', hittin' nothin', even if I gotta bleed
(Sittin', waitin' patient for a universal pain)
Politickin' with the nation, this is big as you and me, huh?
(Electrify my contacts, okay)
Tryna set us off for combat? No way, woo!
(Wakin' up the spirit, it's on every human being)
If you with us then you SCREAM {so they all can shine way out!}
{Me, I'm way, way out}
Way out, way out

[Interlude: Pharrell] + (M.I.A.)
Way, way, way out
(Ayy, ayy)
Wanna bring the fuckin' crayon out
(Hey, hey)

[M.I.A.] + (A$AP Rocky)
The girls in here are the humblest
We drink out our plastic tumblers
While you, see us on Tumblrs
We wanna get a job as a baroness
But they don't want no goddamn foreigners
Say "Hey, you, you wanna marry us?"
Carriers, the cross, they carry us
I wanna get high cause I'm curious
I'm serious, I hope you are feelin' us (woo!)
I'm payin', buy of all these periods (uhh)
When mobiles are runnin' delirious (woo!)
It's our dream, out of this radius (uhh)
I'm lettin' off kites over barriers (woo!)
I'm lettin' off kites over barriers (uhh)
I'm lettin' off kites over barriers (woo!)
L-l-lettin' off kites over barriers (uhh)

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
There's room for so many more
Hey, hey!</pre>

Artist: Nipsey Hussle f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Victory Lap
Song:   Dedication
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Nipsey Hussle]
Look, my nigga this is dedication, this is anti-hesitation
This a real nigga celebration, this a Dime Blocc declaration
Fifty-Ninth and Fifth Ave, granny's house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy, the separation, 2Pac of my generation
Blue pill in the fuckin' Matrix, red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he can't change it
Know he a genius, he just can't claim it
'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you can't fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long 'til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
'Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation

Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin', dedication
It's dedication, look

[Kendrick Lamar]
I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies three on one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life starin' at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss, shit don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said you do a song with Nip, K. Dot he a better crip
I said he a man first, you hear the words out his lips?
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?
Level four, yard livin' and give in to false imprisonment
Listen close my nigga, it's bigger than deuces and fours my nigga
Since elementary we close my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's
I'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication

If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?
Hol' up!

[Nipsey Hussle]
This ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves wit
Ended up on shore to their amazement
I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be stay safe, now it's stay dangerous
'Cause ain't no point in playin' defense nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end nigga, without a life jacket
Couple mil, tour the world, now my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heights backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it

Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin', dedication
It's dedication</pre>

Artist: Nitty Scott, MC f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  The Boombox Diaries, Vol. 1 EP
Song:   Flower Child
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Nitty Scott, MC]
Pardon my Bohemian ways
I know I act like I be stuck in a Bohemian daze
You said you love me, so don't rush me
Love is patient, and now you gotta trust me
to take form, like the canvas of the Grand Canyon
Product of a beautiful storm
Or an unborn, carried just below the heart
Quietly preparing for a start
Let me Michelangelo my Sistine Chapel
You know they say Rome wasn't built in a day
and diamonds need a while 'fore they hit the display
So I guess I see myself in a similar way
I'm paced, like my momma in the kitchen whipping
Always mixing up and fixing
Begged her for a taste, and she said it wasn't ready
She stir it up slow, and she cook it up steady
This is not a race track, living in the ASAP
I'm just trying to do it justice when it play back
Sometimes I gotta start the BPM
So I can weave these dreams and polish up these gems
In the end, I got love for the show biz
But sometimes you gotta stop and smell the roses
Keeping up with the Kardashians and Joneses?
Nah, I take my time and compose this

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
It's a secret garden in my mind, flower child

[Nitty Scott, MC]
Okay, buffering, creativity suffering
when you bustling, hustling for the numbers and
you'll miss the journey if you climb too fast
The beauty of the struggle when it comes to pass
Amateurs swear they need to balance it
I want that legendary like Excalibur, chasing calibers
Liberated as a bachelor, traveler
Never falling victim to these calendars
Uh, rough draft after rough draft
No staff, perfecting all my abstract craft
And now they calling me celebrity
Only thing I give a damn about is my integrity
They play the game like checkers when I'm talking bout chess
Tryna do more when I'm talking bout less, I stress
Quantity ain't always quality
So let me formulate my prophecy

[Kendrick Lamar]
When the lights get low, you'll notice I am the sun
The winter time was snow, but only little you know
how it still breathe, give me the cheese
I'm resuscitating the game, see me and CPR, my name
is a gun cocked, gun shot, dead and I won't stop
Gun cocked, gun shot, head in a pine box
with a dozen roses, holeless with a gift card
Gun cocked, gun shot, flowers on your momma's yard

[Chorus]

[Nitty Scott, MC]
They say greatness gets better with time
So why expedite my prime?
See I'm just a lilac tied to the Earth
Exuding the fragrance of light and birth
So respect my photosynthesis
My petals, my stems, full of nourishing flow
You thought this was a love song, but no
I just need you to let me grow</pre>

Album:  Most Hated Alive (Mixtape)
Song:   Lyrical Gangsta
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta [x5]

When I kick it, I kick it ass as to beat with my enemy
You have thought it was 10 to me on point like a widow peak
Got that liberally give them dearies that do what it do,
Payin a picture like doodling, you ain't shit but do do,
In the city where see me get pointed that damn it you
You can hide, you get it if you want to, I do karate moves
But the crush and tigers just might get broken down by a writer
Yeah the passenger hopped out, but you got shot by the driver
There's a killer like everywhere, so why would you take it there
Neighborhood terrorist got the terror when this people scared
That's why my intelligence tell me to keep a band aid
Tell em fuck you I'll tell you fuck you back with my index finger
I can flip on some killershit but I'd rather keep cool
Keep it so remind it try not to be a pussy like you
Nigga that cali cold attack, cali on my back to my toy so break nigga
This is where set does game

Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta [x5]

I talk a smitten I'm so religious I blow your wicked
Make em close the stiches, hells kitchen I'm throwing dishes
This is spoken wisdom as I journey a poet's mission
I'm a lift it, my flow is gift it
She cold with a bow and ribbon the role of riches
Low the bisquits let's go to distance
I'm blow and listen my car how why you with a broke ignition
They so suspicious, low and vicious with no convictions
Juries making their own decisions they want us to go to prison
Cold adrenaline I got this soul like a poet's living
So is spitting it's like I'm co-existent to prohibition
I'm a dressin critics who say these widows the best as spit it
Disrespect the spirit, or the artist who rap with lyrics
Mother of statistics they rap with metaphysics
And they yeah simplistic, they stay out as repetition
Show some recognition
Heard your album my best of missed it
Best that ever did it
Papoose is the definition

Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta [x5]</pre>

Album:  My Name Is My Name
Song:   Nosetalgia
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Pusha T]
20 plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby face monster
No wonder it's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm and hammer and a mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago tried to fight the urge like Ivan Drago
If he dies he dies, like Doughboy to Tre
If he rides he rides, throwing punches in his room
If he cries he cries, we don't drink away the pain
When a nigga die we add a link to the chain
Inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playing on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills who's gone fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fucking with my sinus
Nigga this is Simon says, Simon red
Blood on your diamonds til you dying; dead
YAH!

[Chorus: sample of "The Bridge is Over" by Boogie Down Productions]
"You better change what comes out your speaker
You better ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch {*scratches*}
Di-di di-da, di di-di, dida di-day, aiy!"

[Kendrick Lamar]
You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my mama's Christmas party
+Troubles, on my Mind+
I still smell crime; my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealing it, hit the pipe and start feeling it
Oh wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, cack when nine ounces have got you ten
And nine times out of ten niggas don't pay attention
And when there's tension in the air nines come with extensions
My daddy dumped a quarter piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat land on his gold
I said "Daddy, one day I'mma get you right with 36 zips
1000 grams of cocaine then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter"
He said "Son, how come you think you be my connect?"
Said "Pops, your ass is washed up with all due respect"
He said "Well nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
Go figure, mothafucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga (please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my grand daddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession
Let's get it...

[Chorus: sample of "The Bridge is Over" by Boogie Down Productions]
You better change what comes out your speakers 
You better ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch {*scratches*}
You better change what comes out your speakers
They must be on the dick of who? 
......
They must be on the dick of who?</pre>

Song:   Better Off
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Better of without you
Better off my baby
Better off without
Better off my baby

And I'm better off without you
Better off my baby
Better off my baby
Better off without you

[Verse 1: Quadron]
I waited for you mainly
Can't believe you made me
Oh lord of daydreams
Leading on the maybes
And why you would treasure me
Search for you and rule me
Close sits on nothing
Why we should be killing

[Bridge 1]
Sorrow Sorrow (searching searching 'em)
Crossed Hearts (you crossed your heart and now you lose)
I'm better without you
Yeah
I'm better without you
Yeah

[Chorus]
Avery [?]
Is only half full in your thoughts
You get no better now
Patiently, cause you're so heavy in my heart
I could do better now

I'm with you
I'm with you (If you really want me to be with you than I can chose)
And you want me
I can choose my own (I could do better)
I know I can do better

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Love is life and life is love, I like to love
Every part of you. The party life can never do enough
So many obstacles the possibilities are breaking up
Can move in hospital with that extra patient you got me stuck
I'll play the prostitute if you've got the patience to pimp me
But you never put me on the strip, put it on then you strip
Put it on your fingertips and I'll kiss it off
You better not kiss me goodbye, Test my faith and kiss the cross
I'm trying to go there, take you slow there if it's alright
Tell me that you care baby we could share a full life
Truth and double dare that I do repair broken hearts
Cupid shot me in the dark, stupid I didn't play my part
Ask for your forgiveness, if it's worth it I can serve a purpose
If I'm st... st... stuttering because I'm nervous
Tell me that you love me still
Promise that I'm staying still
Honesty is all I need
Honestly, we can build

[Bridge 2]
The stakes are full now
Still wait for you
I'm better off with you (I'm better off)
Yeah
I'm better off with you
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'm with you (If you really want me to)
I can't chose life (I can't chose)
I could do better, better now</pre>

Artist: Rapper Big Pooh f/ Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, K. Dot
Album:  Delightful Bars
Song:   Nothing Less
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Rapper Big Pooh]
So everybody put your shades on
Poobie came to show +Love+ like +Faizon+
Every bar that I carve is amaz-on
Wack niggas can't seem to feel our play on
A lil' spice in my swag, call it Cajun
Often wonder to myself where the day's gone
Save some, save none at the same time
Talk shit, take a stand in the same rhyme
Paid homage to the struggle that's before mine
Never bad-handing nothing, therefore I grind
Outshine most niggas, call 'em all suns/sons
Steady reaching for the stars, but it's only one
Rapper, your favourite rapper, this is no +Pun+
+Big Daddy+, no +Kane+, get the job done
I'm bout to stick the whole game up with no gun
and I'ma show you how the South was won
So check it out

[Chorus: K. Dot]
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
and we don't need props, we know we the shit
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
So get them ends hot
I'm yelling all my real niggas, "keep moving"
My real bitches, "keep moving"
I promise I'ma "keep moving"
If they don't, "we do it"
The best (Hip Hop)
I swear to give you nothing less, nothing less

[Ab-Soul]
Uh, yeah, hot damn, here we go again
Lyrical manslaughter off you and your mans
I'm on the stage, you in the stands
I'm on the road, you at the crib just scribbling
Your best sentence was doing your bid
I'm through with you kids, like Brenda
I don't want to have to trash bin ya
When Ab enter, cats get they raps injured
Without no reason they be out the whole season
It sorta becomes a cycle like hoes bleeding
I'm at where you can't come like no semen
No homo, just admire the power
I'm so visual, give you an +Eiffel+ like +tower+
Huh, but you can never see me
Black tear compliment my black lips in the Lamborghini
Puffing a spliff big as a branch
After I spit it niggas be swimming to get to land, damn

[Chorus]

[Jay Rock]
Jay Rock got flows
I'm killing 'em slow like cigarette smoke
Running Hip Hop like 'Pac in his prime
I spit murder, every bar is a crime
Look, I do it BIG like B.I.
Nigga I'm the shit, I've doing this since knee high
No I'm not TIP but I stay on my T.I.
These fake ass rappers steady acting like devise
I'ma live and die in Cali
What's beef? Chew through that like rallies
Got hoes, work 'em out like ballies
Do shows, flip dough like patties
I ain't just rapping, I can make it happen
Put your whole goddamn career in a casket
Lyrical homicide when I write
No bullshit, I'm Mike with the mic

[Chorus]

[K. Dot]
Never pledge allegiance, God given flow
I can out-preach a deacon once the words get to speaking
Give me a reason why I'm not the best breathing
They worship the ground I walk on, though I'm harder than cement
Sticking to the streets like convertible oil leaks
Portable handgun, who want to test?
I can pass out many Scantrons, fail many students
Tryna play the truest, dumber than Three Stooges
Hummers, we steady cruising like time do
Higher than a vanilla sky, float by you
When I'm through, I'll probably let you take it back
like my old prom suit that I wore with the tag
Rap giant, get you little locality smashed
Money in a bag, stones be yellow as a cat
I like bitches with fat booties but never half-ass
when I'm working for certain, I'm hurting the game

I said I'm hurting her
Pooh! I couldn't help it nigga
I had to put a verse this muh'fucker
This shit classic nigga
Feel this, uh, for Hip Hop, for Hip Hop
For real Hip Hop, Hip Hop, Hip Hop</pre>

Album:  Fat Boy Fresh, Volume One: For Members Only
Song:   RapperPooh-A-Lude
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Fair warning, people would have never had a problem
if the naysayers or the doubters would have got him
Slumped if the corner, for sure I'm a goner
Shoot with no aim, so them niggas couldn't spot him
Now I got a question, if I really even want it
when this shit is like a trip through the city of Sodom
Gomorrah, the horror, stories are endless
Workshop, working all night, no apprentice
Funny when a nigga speak truth he a menace
Ushered in the underground, lifelong sentence
There's where I dwell, ain't no need to cry for me
Rapper gonna eat, and I eat well
It's been six years since I stepped out the shell
Talent on the rise to the top, I propel
Big Dho set sail, your boy gon' win
Bet niggas act crazy when they see us again
I'm really going in, I've been had nothing to lose
So I choose to take y'all through a spin
A journey through the mind of a sane ass artist
If you spitting blah-blah shit, you a target
If you spitting blah-blah shit, then just forfeit
What go around come around, now they all on my dick

[Kendrick Lamar]
Kendrick Lamar, I'm bout to get my mop stick
Niggas bump their gums, and their bitches be bumping my shit
I fry your optics, if you watching my style, watch it
Tyrannosaurus reading a thesaurus, hold rappers hostage
Catastrophic, it's 9-11 when I'm repping
Skip college to fly first class, learn a lesson
Straight brutal, roman numerals
Number one eating Ramen noodles, rhyming crucial under the sun
Kudos to the most high, which is me
I probably make 'em plan their suicide, so usually
I ain't never been with the shit starting, but y'all done started some shit
I'm bout to drink some ex-lax then commence
to returning the favor to all of my neighbors and comrades
Calm down, you more like Trina than Trinidad at spots now
Throw your dubs up
Pussy probably holding Daisy Dukes and C-cups
I look inside this industry and I don't see much
I just see lunch, and your shit that's more bore like tourists
I'm laid back, got feet up, how cool is that?
The twenty-ten Kool G. Rap, whenever I rap
I got my arsenal stuck on my back, I'm ready for war
They tend to look for me when they fiend for Afeni Shakur
Conversing, not hibernating, under the planet core
At thirteen I cancelled PG-13 and went for gore
That's what I pledge
It's profound that I'm underground touching 'mainstreams' like river beds

[Ab-Soul]
Yeah, (Ab-Soul) they saying he a breath of fresh air (light?)
They can't smell all this weed that I brought in here
Black & Mild smoke still linger on my clothes
So unprofessional, I shouldn't be meeting with millionaires
Pull up a chair, I'll school you to it
I was a student truant that never studied, just always knew it
You just new to it, with no clue on how you should do it
like youth in junior high school when puberty's looming
And mind you, I never mined you, I ain't digging for gold
Honestly, I just want to stick my dick in some hoes
Kick a flow, hit the 'dro with my bros
Tippy-toe in this rap game, make a lil' name
with this lil' lane I've been paving since I was a teen
that I never really thought that I would attain
When Big Pooh dropped 'Sleepers' I could barely get a feature
They ain't know this regular nigga would be the future
I've viewed the roof from the floor, I've been here before
I'm finna blow a couple of times over like two tubas
And I'ma still want more with this appetite
till the critics stop giving me mixed signals like traffic lights
You know? The lavish life, but for now I'm the new Kunta
Slave to my rhyme book, a line of mine, your time's up
The bastard kissing your bitch with the blackened suit coolers
She'll testify, excuse Judas when I'm crucified</pre>

Artist: Rapsody f/ Kendrick Lamar, Lance Skiiiwalker
Album:  Lailaâs Wisdom
Song:   Power
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Interlude: sample of Bootsy's Rubber Band "May The Force Be With You"]
"Into my world
 There's this power that pulls us closer
 Deeper in love
 There's this power that pulls us like magnets"

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker] + (woman)
I feel your energy, hey (feel your energy)
It's comin' through (it's comin' through)
Took me a century, hey (a century)
To get next to you (to get next to you)
Plus make some enemies, hey (make some enemies)
Invested in you (invested in you)
So I feel your energy, uh (I feel your energy)
Invested, pursuuuuue

[Rapsody]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I never read the 48 Laws
The power of the dussy make a grown man cry
The day I came up out my momma, I saw a grown man cry
They say it has magic powers, even Magic ain't die
Wake you up out ya sleep to take a 3 A.M. car ride
He said the booty the only thing between him and God
They love the booty, sacrifice they family and job
Badge make police feel powerful in the hood
Guns make us feel powerful but they don't do no good
I know my blackness powerful and they don't like that
I know some niggas sold theirs, sit back and watch 'em tap dance
+Bombs over Baghdad+ to have a flag to brag 'bout
Don't make you a +big boy+, cause you got a nice +Stack+
Carolina home boy, you know we keep a stackhouse
That's power when you know the game, I'm feelin' like a champ now
I went the rap route, homie get out the trap house
I want the power to be able rap 'bout what I rap 'bout
Black child, God, love and textiles, point blank decimal
Steph Curry projectile, I saw the goal from eight miles
With every stone you threw, I picked it up and built a powerhouse
Caught a case, I got murder in my profile
Niggas still billin' me, see that's just the appeal in me
Respek on my name, why y'all niggas so emotional?
Power!

[Chorus]

[Rapsody]
Uhh, power up with the word, I got it from my God
He said a good shepherd don't trip over what they heard/herd
Let 'em talk the talk until the night you choose to go and purge
I came up when the rest of you struggled and failed to flourish
Conversations with the florist, she said I'm good as herbs
Get 'em high, get 'em high from the hood to the suburbs
No one can take your power even if a storm occurred
It ain't man-made but whether or not you paid don't help or hurt
It's a perk, Jamla Squad written on my shirt
I got a lane but all the lines around me dotted, I can merge
I can do what you can but you can't do the same with words, as I
Now watch my street cred go multiply
They say the streets respect the real ones, no one as real as I
It's just me and young blood, this where I get all of my power
The night I got a chain from Mr. Flowers
I gave it back when I got done rappinâ the same hour
I ain't Five Percent 'less we talkin the top emcees
And I'm in the top of that, the rest beneath me all cowards
When it spits, look around, it's meteor showers
I watch the stars fall fall fall, yeah this what you call power

[Interlude]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Letâs talk about power
Let's talk about yours and ours that paid the allowance
Let's talk about hundred thousand kids ravinâ and bouncin'
Cravin' and drownin' in words the day I pronounced it
Let's talk about power, let's talk about do'ers and don't'ers
The house I built when I was homeless and sleepin' in corners
Sharin' Coronas and Black & Milds, donuts in El Caminos
Talkin' loud, scrapin' and combin', residue every mornin'
Talk about legacy, let's talk about the life of celebrity
Verses integrity, curse the first one that thirst for necessity
Searchin' for equity verses the earth that birthed us indefinitely
Verse the verse I wrote in jeopardy, surfin' the laws of the universe and destiny
Church and a God is all that's ever been 'head of me, aw
Let's talk about my power, the golden child was
Granted to be on your cameras and store counters
He's bananas, competitive, we can dance
See the damage, no more for he peed his pants
My second LP had real niggas on POTUS lawn
My seven trophies is at my Granny's and Heaven's arms
I'm in Jamaica like "Wah gwaan", my feet is out
My hair is long and patois comin' from my mouth
Me I go outdoors, it's time to bless up er'ry
Rude boy, me I ain't worry 'bout it, fearless
I shot niggas then shot movies ten years later
Dear God, why you show me so much favor?
Amongst the haters and wickedness (wickedness)
Deliver this child from evil convictions and frivolous (frivolous)
Debates about who's the prominent emcee of the millennium (millennium)
And it's all for the Benjamins (uh-huh) and I'm all of y'all nemesis (thatâs right)
And I'm all in all happy none of y'all can fathom who Kendrick is
The only one that ever did wrote the Book of Genesis
Motherfucker, that's power

[Outro: sample of Bootsy's Rubber Band "May The Force Be With You"]
"Into my world
 There's this power that pulls us closer
 Deeper in love
 There's this power that pulls us like magnets
 And may the force that be with us forever
 Be right here to guide us
 Your sensitivity is very sensitive to miiiine"</pre>

Artist: Isaiah Rashad f/ Kendrick Lamar, Zacari
Album:  The Sun's Tirade
Song:   Wat's Wrong
Typed by: Cedmaster3K
 
[Isaiah Rashad]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I, cut my hair and bump my head and fell off top
and run on sins and front on friends
If we don't win then pay your tithes and mend your fence
and we alright, the Kaio Kens and big old rims
And L.A. hoes, if that ain't rolled up, I ain't go
I ain't home, I ain't them, I ain't them
No more ends and no more trends
and photo tint and photo lens
Notice this, pour this shit
Bonafided, woe is me, bowl of grits
Naked pimp, beamin' up, clean as fuck
Other side, chill for niggas
Makin' life look clear for niggas, hill for niggas
Tip top cliff for niggas, this the vision, side-to-side
So give the nigga, if we honest you gon' miss a nigga
Twisted with 'em, this the isms
See your bitch might kiss a nigga
Which nigga? Get specific
Big ass pot, wrist is glistened
Your list is shit and your if, it isn't
Let's call some titties, and scar your face
The robe of wrongs has caught a case
Other niggas they +Mobb+ like Carter say from far away
All my niggas like "Calm down"
Lovin' life above a reason
Just can't find it like a dozen people
Catch that vibe at night, and Bobby, Whitney
Get too tired to write and died in prison
Felt like Rob tonight
Lost my god tonight, yeah...
 
[Chorus: Zacari]
Ohh, sometimes I get so ahead of myself
Feel like I'm - runnin' in circles
Ohh and I'm just holdin' onto my breath
I need a - smoke just to exhale
Ohh and I get so ahead of myself
But I'll - make it out somehow
So roll another one, roll another one
And put it - all in the air now
 
[Kendrick Lamar]
How many souls do you touch a day?
How many hoes do you fuck a day?
How many flows do your thought convey?
How many know you can't walk away?
Dependin' on the way I feel, I might kill everybody around me
Might heal everybody around me, how the wind blow
Open your window, at the debris and never let me in
I kick back with kick though
Maybe if I could live a hundred years that be real
Pay me if I'ma be rhymin' these homonyms
Crazy my other show went to my mom and 'em
My daddy said a Mercedes had haunted him
But now he got one, I'm ridin' shotgun
with a three-piece chicken dinner and shotgun
I bring your weekend to an ending and pop one
I'm in the deep end, boss nigga you not one
And I believe in Kool-Aid and God's son
Do you believe that black man is our son?
I made enough residuals to hide some
I gave enough, my niggas know I divide some
I told Zay I'm the best rapper since twenty five
Been like that for a while now, I'm twenty-nine
Any nigga that disagree is a fuckin' liar~!
Pardon me, see my alter ego was Gemini
Him and I been around ever since Reagan was criticized
Might stay in the Trump Tower for one week
Spray paint all the walls and smoke weed
Fuck them and fuck y'all and fuck me
I proceed my last check in proceeds
to all the kids, the hood, the bricks, the books
To fix the blocks we on to right my wrongs
The word, to give the life we live as I get...
 
[Chorus] - minus first four words
 
[Isaiah Rashad] + (Zacari)
Oh you got two Xannies, oh just don't forget me
Love me for the moment (all in the air now) hug me like your sibling
We ain't that important, vice cops in the kitchen
Grew with Apollonia (all in the air now) Rob was makin' chicken
Beat me down, you beat me down, reorganize my face
Now, when I go home, I don't know what my fam gon' say
They, say it ain't love cause you bought flowers yesterday
Thoughts, was always cheap cheap cheap but now let's talk 'bout me me me
Lately I been comin', this ain't goin' how I wanted
When I pull up at your window, bitch come out, you hear that beep beep beep
Faithful as your EBT, closer than you momma can
Anger when you rang up, I'm a dog but I'm gon' crawl again
Freak me out, keep me out, why they always leave me out?
Niggas that been hatin' just can't wait to have my CD now
Don't we look like CP and Nirvana on that keep me pound
Please be down, I been more than late...
 
[Chorus]
 
[Zacari]
All in the air now...</pre>

Album:  Rich Gang
Song:   100 Favors
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Detail]
Shout-out {*harmonizing*}
Swear I be sittin' here thinkin' 'bout the shit that we've been through
And all I know is girl I owe you 100, 100, 100 favors
I owe you 100 favors, 100, 100, 100 favors
100 favors

[Detail]
Niggas all talk, it'll never change
Keep on choosin do your thang
Girl, all them favors, I call her like a driver
Drowning in that pussy, and I'm a soul survivor
Vodka, hunned flavors, GT watermelon
She always do me favors, and I don't never tell her
GT yellow mango, I love to drink juice
Owe her 100 favors, I call her my 100 proof
Man I heard about an angel

[Chorus: Detail]
Now I'm sitting here sippin' on the last bit of vodka and I ever see is your face
Swear I be sitting here thinking bout the shit that you've been doing
And all I know is girl I owe you 100, 100, 100 favors
I'll give you 100 favors, 100, 100, 100 favors.. YEAH~!
And now I'm sitting here sippin' on the last bit of GT
And all I ever see is your face; 100 favors
{*harmonizing*} Hunnid, hunnid

[Birdman]
Shout-out, shout-out, yeah...
Prices with the life, rollin on them dice
Spent a mill on a flight 
Flew back and she bounced back, high speed
All gold, +Lord of the Ring+
We live that life big time, big time
100 times I gave my bitch the sunshine
Harley Davis, Harley Davis 
Twin cam, I gave my bitch a 100 favors

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
You was a college student abusing the credit union
The music was way too loud, the tuition was fuckin stupid
And me I was runnin' wild hittin' licks in my mothers' Buick
Confusing, you like my style even though I was broke and doing
Stick em ups, you wanna pick em up inside your Civic 
Plus the difference was I wasn't rich as fuck you still would depend on us
And I missed the crush that we had every time winter December come
And we had tempers and arguments, disagreements and senses from
Cupid himself, and I'm shootin' himself
And the paramedics won't come even if you scream for help
Don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself
And I'm losing now too looking at you boo hoo from what's dealt
So as I reminisce the coupon that we used to split at Baileys
On your mothers couch your little brother in the alley
You say K. Dot your page got that pay that Birdman and Jay got
One day you'll reap what you sow, now I reap for us both
That's one hunnid

Artist: Scoe f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Tha Influence
Song:   Thank You
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus: Scoe]
"Thank you Doctor"
Reminiscing when we used to smoke chronic
Now we puffing the kush
I'm like, "Thank you Doctor"
For giving the West Coast CPR
Now here we are
We'd like to, "Thank you Doctor"
We can never pay you pack
All the shit you did for Hip Hop and gangster rap
For that, "Thank you Doctor"
Without further adieu
Diggy Doc, this one is for you, uh huh

[Scoe]
I remember growing up, just a Dogg Pound pup
Bumping "G Thang", it's that "Gin and Juice" in my cup
And all I knew was N.W.A.
Eazy, Yella and Ren, Ice Cube and Dre
Big Snoop, Warren G, Nate Dogg and Rage
Kurupt and Daz, RBX, the original gang
Bad Azz, Soopafly, I can go on for days
D.P.G.C., that's the way I was raised
And motherfucking 2Pac was my shit
Especially when he was rocking on the Doc shit
Killa Cali where it all started, a legacy
Me? I'm just happy to be a part of it
This west shit, it's history in the making
This is the next step, California's best kept, yep
It's young Scoe, I'm a Y.A. gangster rider
On behalf of South Central L.A., we wanna

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I remember when it all started
On Alondra in that small apartment, burgundy carpet and Sega cartridges
Poppa flicking blunt ashes all on his garments
Momma off of wine cooler, Magic Johnson playing Jordan
I was only four, but it's like I heard it before
A house party cracking off of the music Doctor record
And according to my awareness, I was more than coherent
A cold listener, marking that shit like a parrot
My cousins kicking up dust Cripping, they flag, wear it
round they hand like a mitten, aiming, use it for leverage
Shitting on Compton sheriffs like "Fuck the Police"
Woofers and gold Rollies, every swap meet should know me
Cause I copped every record that dropped
Dropped a dub just to hear Doc drop a jewel for the sake of Hip Hop
Whoever thought the moment I seen you on Bullis for "Cali' Love"
Fifteen years later you'd be saving my life, what?

[Chorus]</pre>

(I just got a burner, where they at?)
Three! If you in this motherfucker, make noise right now
(Car doin' doughnuts in a flash)
Four! (Straight like this, I need my money in a bag)

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh yeah, I been countin' dead men, puttin' bodies in the safe (safe)
5200, one swipe, throw it away ('way)
Ayy, whip, whip, whip, 'til it stain on ya (stain on ya)
Ayy, whip, whip, whip, 'til it stain on ya (stain on ya)
I been countin' dead men, puttin' bodies in the safe (safe)
5200, one swipe, throw it away ('way)
Ayy, whip, whip, whip, 'til it stain on ya (stain on ya)
Ayy, whip, whip, whip, 'til it stain on ya (stain on ya)

[ScHoolboy Q]
Ayy, got it on me, if I ain't got nothin' that matter on me
Dare one try, who frontin' on me? Ain't no smut, no chatter on me
Money on me, hundred on me, both got rocks, look better on me
Spaceship parked, no landin' on me, wrecked my Lam', don't need it on E
Four words I know, yeah, fuck all you hoes, ayy
I do the most, ayy, put that in quotes, ayy
Diamond on me, jumpin' on me, you lil' boys can't match milli' on me
10K fit, put Groovy on fleek, D-boy fresh since school '03
Speed Racer, top down on E-way
Throw it back like replay, most of y'all won't be safe
I came from hard knocks, I stack, bring more knots
Gang tats and stovetops, act like you know us, you punk biatch

[Chorus]

[ScHoolboy Q]
First mil' showed up, ayy, 'Rari gon' go nuts, ayy
Jewelry hang all out, ayy, bitches gon' call now, ayy
Dollars ain't C-notes, ayy, house on each coast, ayy
Glock goes emo, ayy, Porsche sound Deebo, ayy
Four words I know, yeah, fuck all you hoes, ayy
Chain whip, dip splash, uh, slim bitch, all ass, ayy
Brew fresh pots, I serve, this my wrist, iceberg
Real life rich, get curved, bitch look fine, still broke
Bitch my wrist came woke, big bling, wrist got sold
I must live my worth, chain drip down my shirt
My block been Iraq, three mil', paid my tax
Your shit seized, all bad, feel my back, all cash

[Chorus]</pre>

Artist: ScHoolboy Q f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  6 Foot 7 (S)
Song:   6 Foot 7 *
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

* obviously a freestyle over the Lil Wayne song

[Kendrick Lamar]
Said I'm a fuckin monster a massive attack'll haunt ya
I mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors
Mastered that, after that I went for thermometers
Popped 'em all as they popped in the jaw of Tracy Veronica
Holla back~! They promised us, no pajamas insomnia
will attack, I attack like pirahna does
Hit your block like a comet, BLAP
And you all know what time it is, 20-12 mark your calendars
Calisthenics and silencers, exercisin that trigger STRIP~!!
Rock with us Metallica, competition no talent
Hum in the jungle what's wild enough?
Just might stumble upon a PACK, of lions
No lyin my soilders dyin this is I-RAQ
Alliances linin with stars and bars of a prison WRECK
My science applyin pressure her strecher is needed
pay the proceeds, or you live in DEBT!
Y'all soft as a giga-pet; you niggaz can't see me
unless you watchin the TV or ultra huggin my SILHOUETTE
My flow got the ceiling WET; I spit 'til I feel my BREATH
go sink in my fuckin chest
She fuckin the fuckin best, mean my dick is the dick of death
Means I'm killin that pussy like Spike whenever that Jerry slept

Yo Dre! Me and Andre the Giant 6'7" and climbin
Whether you storm to your climate, whether your beat makin or rhymin
Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman, handful of diamonds like Jay fans
On a island wit Ray Bans
Glasses palmin asses that probably came wit a great tan, hee hee
I be the motherfuckin Mecca of these Hub City spectrum
Where they at? I will disect 'em like a fuckin frog's rectum
While you wreckin with a wreckin ball my words flow incredible
They probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Et cetera et cetera, Bentley passin up Celicas
They tellin us about shit, #HiiPoWer in your mouth bitch!
And top dog can vouch bitch; nigga what you 'bout?A
bout face wit army outfits, the general's here
That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
Penitence reachin pinacles of life and despair
And me I solemnly swear
to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never askin Allah for it!
Only difference is I be spazzin and still apply for it!
Put me in a category, I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory, yo' pain bore me, you ain't really lived it
I take you to a block where they Crippin
or Piru that 5'2 gun, bigger than the torso of Pippin
Bitch I been doin before you niggaz ruined it show me somethin different
You either kissin dick or givin me distance
You live in a disrict of dimebags and dummys; I know your statistics
Who your boss he more like my assisstant?
Get lost have a egg and a biscuit
Break-fast when we aimin them biscuits
Pay cash when ya chain come up missin, Q!!!

[ScHoolBoy Q]
(Q!) Double ups dude what the fuck?
Get me some my promo poppin, "Setbacks" droppin soon they watchin
I just lock and load explode, target flowed I'm somewhere blowed
Mary got some swishers sweets, L.A. nigga prolly east
Cheerin for the ragin beats, X-O Henny' scrape the keys
Bangin C I'm bangin B, put them niggaz next to me
Stop and focus get the lead, I'm hear now let the hardest be
Shit all them dudes got ovaries - PERIOD~!
Run on sentence still I'm ventin air conditionin coolest breeze
Ill diseases, grip my pant and shoot my semen
Still I'm cumin miles a runnin
I was learnin getting knowledge, head is throbbin, she a goblin
We be mobbin over bitches, stick and miss and she the business
Get a witness pussy frenchin, just a mission
poppin off like on a mission, proposition
Getting money, drop a nigga
Rush a nigga, stomp a nigga
Crush a nigga, dust a nigga
Copperhead gon' crush a nigga, heatin up the winter nigga
Somethin to remember nigga, hella sick I got a spit
Cursed with a verse like, God told me kill the shit
Load a clip, hecklin cops, the Hoover king~!
Bada bing by the ding-a-ling, natural Hoover
Fing' ring with a vision clearer than Visine, Asiang from Beijing
Money make her cum she cream; feed the weak that's WingStop
At the start wit rain drops, Autobots
Space shuttle, shittin on your car lots - boy stop!
Could at least got excitin huh? #HiiPoWer you see our pattern huh?
Workin on tracks like we never been free
22 squezze niggaz shootin off C's, please let a nigga bar 16's
Rhyme 16's, bada bing bing bing
Bing bing! Bing bing bing bing {*laughing*}

[Outro]
If you want to be from #HiiPoWer
please come to friend zone
But don't wowwwy
You will not suck on my dick tonight</pre>

You can do clown dance, I'ma rob that store
You can paint your face, I'ma kick down doors, I'ma shoot my gun, I'ma free my loc

Song:   Birds & THe Beez
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[ScHoolboy Q]
Straight to the block, to the hood, to a spot
Cocaine to a rock, deuce-deuce in a sock
Every dollar closer to a drop, every drop is closer to a cop
Every cop is closer to a cell, hit the cell, your ticket right to hell
No job, no bail, no fam, no mail
New statistic, another nigga fail, go from pussy to a prison tale
Fuck that, I quit while I'm ahead, ship my music off like I'm Astaire
Turn it up and hear the ghetto pledge, live righteous nigga like my brother said
King Tut, Martin Luther, Malcolm X, but I'm his shooter
Top rhyming/ramen, knowledge for the noodle, finally getting praised, yeah kudos
Doing bad, still loving E, connect, said it's something up his sleeve
Said, I'd rather bust off them ki's, yeah nigga, birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez

Want to do a song, but it's hard to carry on
And my daughter hungry sitting home, and my girl, she said she feel alone
I can tell it's over in her tone, only time I call is for a loan
She be stressing, so depressing, always worried every time a lil' nigga gone
Stay strong for the future, stick together, yeah suture
Get a couple whips, yeah Kunta, ScHoolboy but gangsta was his tutors
Say that money be the root of evil, look around see what it do to people
Veins leap from heroin use or PCP, inject their body with a needle
Lord help us, swear to God, dope dealers get a job
Keep it real, this shit ain't really cool, being in a cell you ain't alive
Niggas quick to show out over cheese, love to help the Devil do a deed
So I'd rather bust off the ki's, yeah nigga, birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez

Tired of the same old shit, niggas, they faking it
Niggas out here living foul, better yet they flagrant
Teach these niggas right about the game, get these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy and leave this dope alone and count my change

[Kendrick Lamar]
Q, I want to see you do your thang, entertainment business, living limelight
Hop on every track and move them trains, show these motherfuckers that you've been tight
than they ever been, it's evident that you intelligent but you can't escape that life
And for you my nigga I would sacrifice myself to make it just to see you hold the mic
and hit the stage and rock the set, but it's hard to change when you from the set
Won't you think about it nigga, life or death? Like a cracker like to hang ya by the neck
Do you wanna see the boys and jet, or you wanna see them runway jets?
Fly to Singapore, one-way that, tell the pilot we got stacks on deck
Swear to God it's hard out here for a young black man to live
If you don't do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids
My nigga won't you tell Michelle I love your daughter, please don't let her grow up, life without her father
Look at what you bought her money couldn't buy, all she need is love, put the shit aside
At the same time know they gotta eat, know you got to hustle, make ends meet
Gotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, HTC
No A.C. and the block hot, you keep running, cops say freeze
Blue pill, red pill, choose now, birds or the beez?
Birds or the beez?
Birds or the beez?

[ScHoolboy Q]
Tired of the same old shit, niggas, they faking it
Niggas out here living foul, better yet they flagrant
Get these niggas right up out the game, get these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy and leave this dope alone and count my change
Count my change
Count my change</pre>

[Intro: Trayvon Ray Cail]
Our experience to where we have parents in our lives
that was showin' us everythin'
Like didn't nobody walk us, by our hand
and show us how you do this and don't do that
It wasn't like that comin' up in our mu'fuckin' community
where we grew up at
We grew up off of, what, cigarillos
Actin' like a, uh uh uh, a worldwide blade
A real strength, a real, real hope scope
I mean, ya know, like
You got a momma tellin' you somethin'
A deli, a daddy tellinâ you somethin
And at the same time, you got your daddy
He-he-he-he around the corner, gettin' high off the he-ron
Your momma on the county, ya know
Your mom can't afford to take care of ten kids
I mean, you know what I mean? It was likeâ¦

[ScHoolboy Q]
Yeahâ¦
Smokin' the gas on the regular man
Ya know what I mean? Word
Sippin' on Hen, that's the regular
Ya know what I mean? Word, uhh

Pissy sofas, sharin' food with roachesâ¦ uhh
On gangsta Crip, my poppa was a bitch
Left me where hope just don't exist
And every neighbor got a fence
With, bars on windows, my mom's slavin' for the rent
Throwin' dices, GT Dyno groovin'
Where you hang, we shootin', you slip, you stiffin'
Creative Crippin', uhh
Hang on, uhh, bitches stoppin' traffic
This that type of shit that, make the MAC a classic
Reason I'm pussy magnet, she learned to carry package
Been the best at rappin', uhh
I'm hot as Vegas
Your favorite rapper broke, he don't get this paper, but claim he got a kilo
Been born in '93 though, he tryna fool the people
Maaaaaan

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The joke's on you muâfucka
The loc is on you muâfucka; I warned ya, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma

[ScHoolboy Q]
Yup yup, uhh
Ain't nothin' changed but the change, let's put our brains away from gangs
Crips and Bloods the old and new slaves
Shit we even changed our names
Tiny somethin' Lil Shane while we bang
But yo, y'all ain't hearin' me
My homie facin' life, he told me that my pride my biggest enemy
But, you keep your eyes in that dark
Your mind, it greys your heart, I wrote these rhymes days apart
Most of us caught before we can expand our thoughts
How your grandmother see your corpse?
How your big homie make your life a book?
Left you for dead cause he ain't lead you right, but I'm gon' freedom write
Mm, let's put the rags down and raise our kids
Let's put the guns down and blaze a spliff
Let's do it now, ain't no buts or ifs
It took a Blood to get me Pringle chips; you can learn to fly or take the ladder
Real nigga shit, all lives matter
Both sides - maaaaaan...

[Chorus]</pre>

[ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo, uh
What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night, needing a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga

One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that motherfucker to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate dog
I was hanging on them corners late, pockets wasn't straight bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
but I figured I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for
Load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that will never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep going hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray
Just wanna say, ay

[Chorus 2X: ScHoolboy Q]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes my nigga
We all blessed my nigga

[ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son while I'm here hugging on my daughter
I grip her harder, kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him like, it'll be okay
You'll be straight, it'll be aight
Well fuck that shit, whatever you need, yo I got it
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work, fuck it then I'm riding
Uh, you know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved that I'd be a fucking fool
to be living by the street rules
Fuck police tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith, stay strong bruh, remain solid bruh
Keep playing ball cause it's the only way up out it bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come, but most, I'm sorry for your son

[Chorus 2X]

[Ab-Soul]
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere and I'ma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere, but I'ma always be right here

[Kendrick Lamar] + (ScHoolboy Q)
Living in a premature place... wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates... break
every time a bullet detonate... dates
of obituary, carry crates
of a scary picture with a family member that relate
to ya, in December you was finna pin another case
on your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had moved you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read again
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't (blessed my nigga)
Yes my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
for the progress of a baby step my nigga
Step, step my nigga, one, two, skip, skip
Back, back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
this crack into rap music, every other zip/.zip
is a track, get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it, then recognize that we all

[Chorus 2X]</pre>

Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro]
Yea, yea, yea
Uh, uh.. yo, yo

[Chorus: Schoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching could buy anything, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens
Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh, down with that shit
King shit, smoke this, get down with the shit, aye
Oh, oh, down with the shit
This, that, pop this down with the shit

[Schoolboy Q]
Smoke this, drink this, straight to my liver
Watch this, no tick, yeah, Im the nigga
Gang rap, X-mas, smoke, shots out the liver
Faded, Vegas, might sponsor the killer, shit
Shake it, break it, hot-hot for the winter
Drop it, cop it, eyes locked on your inner object
Rock it, blast-blast, new beginnings
Lovely, pinky how not I remember
Fiendin'; gimme, gimme, gimme some
Freak the freckles off your face, frenchy, freaking, swapping tongue
Click my link and spread your buns, lose your denim, make it numb
Blow it baby, no Saddam (icky, icky, icky)
Fucking in the car service, thank me for the car pool
Chromosome, part full, prolly off a Norco
And gas, not the Arco, poppin' since the intro
You shoppin' from the window, play my favorite tempo

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Hold up, BIATCH! This your favorite song
Translation: Ven aqui mami, asi culo
Tu quiero coger mi huevos y papi molestes pero
Chuparse puto pendejo el pinche cabron; let's get it
Nights like this I'mma knight like this, sword in my hand, I fight like this
I am more than a man, I'm a God bitch, touche, en garde
Toupée drop and her two tits pop, out of that tank top and bra
And when I say "Doo Doo Doo Doo!" Bitch, that be K. Dot
She want some more of this - I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, I'm forgis
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this, and focus
And slow it down, alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics, poppin' out, you look the weirdest
Pop my top on the 105 head with no power steering, ah!

[Chorus]

[Schoolboy Q]
Bummy nigga famous, straight from the bottom
Broke niggas hate it, still never robbed 'em
Guns in the basement, out they have a problem
Kush be my fragrance, we love marijuana
Function on fire, burn the roof off this motherfucker
Psych ward is ballin', dope craze like no other
Weed steady blowing, pass the blunt to my Mama
Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiendin'
Uh, faded faded faded right
Shot glass super size, she gon' get some dick tonight
Meet me at the W, and no its not the westside
Stick it up me southside (icky icky icky)
Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude
What these niggas make a year, I spend that on my daughter shoes
Smoking weed and drinking, all the college students loving Q
We gon' turn it out until the neighbors wanna party too

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: woman, Cudi, ScHoolboy]
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
Just a lil' buzzed, just a lil' buzzed
Just a lil' buzzed, just a lil' buzzed
Just a lil' buzzed, just a lil' buzzed
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk

[ScHoolboy Q]
Never had enough, pass me the mask, ayy
Are you down for me girl? Been on my last, ayy
See the sirens pullin' up, pigs on my ass, ayy
Even when the money come, gone way too fast, ayy
Why my grandma couldn't live? Gone way too fast, ayy
Cousin murdered in the field, gone way too fast, ayy
Got a liver full of 'gnac, weed in the bag, ayy
Got Ciroc for the hoes, chill on the stash, ayy
Screw my shi...
Pass me the gas
488, stuntman, blast from the past
Got my damn trunk in the front, tire up in the back, ayy
Hell yeah a nigga drunk, buzzed if they ask, ayy
Check it out

[Chorus: woman, Cudi, ScHoolboy] + (Kendrick)
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk

I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really (hol' up)

[6LACK]
Drunk, drunk drunk
Just a lil' buzzed, just a lil' buzzed
Don't be worried baby, this is what I does
Backstroke, lookin' for a quick flood
And you be lyin' when you say you want our, love...
Two cups in and you already lookin' for love...

[ScHoolboy Q]
You a cutie and lookin' purrty and perfect, what you drinkin'?
Feel amazin', imagine, we get to thinkin'
I'll explore you and tour you and keep it cordial
She prestigious, the cleanest, I could be dreamin'
Fuck my ex is a no-no
Did the love thing, and it cost me, she crossed me
Let me work it, you feel your virgin in circles
The groovy Capo, I keep it nasty, attractive
Hit it backwards, do it faster and faster, this a classic
I done mastered the climax, you feel the pressure
Hit it over and over, we doin' extra
I can stretch you and fold up
We get to mobbin', bottle poppin', I'm stress-free
You gave me options, life is best in the backseat, ayy
... Sunshine give me light
Words ain't soundin' bright, girl come and spend a night, ayy

[Chorus: woman, Cudi, ScHoolboy]
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk (woop!)
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
Just a lil' buzzed, just a lil' buzzed
Just a lil' buzzed, just a lil' buzzed
Just a lil' buzzed, just a lil' buzzed
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk</pre>

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, the ground rising, the sun falling
My day is cool, my night's yawning {*yawns*}
Uh, ain't nothing else to do but
move at the speed of light, ayyy, I'm taking flight
Uh, yeah, NASA left behind
I'm so beyond, somewhere with Megatron
I'm super gone, you can't relate to him
and ummm, let me free my mind
Ooooh, I see it all
The galaxy, she want my all
Uh, feel like it's child's play
Dive through a Milky Way, fulfill my destiny
As I cooperate, I record plays
My record spins, nigga whirlwind
Yeah, I see it all
Become a star, tryna shine through the fall, aw

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
See you in the morning, take off nigga, I'm time-zoning
Tell 'em I'm sky-high
Going-going-going up there nigga, I'm time-zoning
Tell 'em I'm sky high

See you in the morning, going-going-going

The ground rising, the moon falling
My night's cool, my day's yawning {*yawns*}
Uh, ain't nothing else to do but
move at the speed of light, ayyy
We travel like a comet, supersonic, just watch out when I accelerate
Moving at the speed of light, ain't no thoughts of me using brakes
Uh, inhaling gravity, excelling Hubble
Check my levels, check my levels, turn me up, turn me up
What the fuck? Got your bitch, she on my nuts, on my nuts
all because a nigga cool, man I swear she act a fool
Man you know I keep it real, man for reals
Man you know I'm super-ills, went to Pluto, gave it chills
Man I swear there no appeals, rising from my heels
with no ceiling over ground, probably never coming down
Yeah, I see it all
Become a star, tryna shine through the fall, aw

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
My turbo boosting, my jet pack cruising
Get jet lag when I come back to these fucking humans
I can put planet Earth in a canister
then continue my crater search with Captain Kirk
Look at my verse, you seeing signs
You hearing signals deciphered from District 9
No fucking rapper cipher when meteors flying
The meters are flying, but I'm way faster
Run away, bet I catch up, fire like striking matches
I'm higher with martians laughing in spaceships, it's starships crashing
Hover above the masses, a massive attack when mixing
Kendrick Lamar with magic, pull rabbits from hats
Niggas, wanna hope on tracks, bitches, wanna hop on dick, damn~!
Is that a fucking blimp? No O-M-G that's him
A shooting star hanging over a new eclipse, hanging over a big dick
When my music flip, nigga I'm sky high, shit

[Chorus]</pre>

[Kendrick Lamar]
Lifestyles of a kid that never had shit
Living off that bad shit, that shoot shit, that stab shit
Rock a flag and don't give a fuck about U.S. flag shit
George Bush got some nerve, fuck a war, we tryna serve
motherfucking eight-balls till we live at the pool hall
and knock billiards out of business, ya bitch
That's my surroundings in Compton, have common sense
Smell death in the air round here, that's a common scent
You know the gunpowder
You when your homie barely blink he just done powder, only at seventeen
You know the common statistic inspired by Hoop Dreams
Now hired by street schemes of getting blood money
I try my best to stay focussed and hope the city love me
Pray it's not lust, cause if it is I'll be dead in a month
Lord forbid, for the good kid, they took his life
She want her baby back like a cooked rib, but that's just life
where I'm from

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If there's a shining star
Hope my city's not too far
So we can live again
See, where I come from it's hard
Hope all over we can start
So we can live again, so we can live again

[CurT@!n$]
I seen this youngun on the train, I had to pick his brain
He said he on his way uptown to get a brick of 'caine
He said he needed a come up cause selling nicks was lame
He needed a change, so I gave him fifty cent
He looked at me like I was crazy, I said listen man
I'd rather give you my last to see you live again
Just cause you change what you pitching don't make the difference
You gotta get off the mound and put the game down
Petty thoughts could keep your brain down
I leave you with that jewel, go get the chain now, and put it together
See, coming up we ain't have shit to keep our mind focussed
I love Mike, but it was a hassle trying to buy Jordans
My nigga hustled all day in front of the corner store
to get a pair, and niggas killed him right in front of the mall
Huh, so all that hustling for nothing then
I threw my pair on the light pole because of him
like, fuck it man

[Chorus]

[ScHoolboy Q]
Tryna move forward, though it never stops
A mother's son dead, was killed by some kids, popped shots
They back and forth
Murder for murder, the beef recycled is vital
No idols, bunch of 'em read bibles
Allies that turned to rivals, niggas turned street disciples
Smokers get high as Eiffels
Addicted to being fiends cause of Feds, as we pledge to let our plague spread
Tiny this, and if it that they banging back
as they a-dapt to being black, straps and gang tats, look
Rats get mouse traps, can't afford tuition
But hit a lick, I bet I earn crack, I heard that
Looking at the sky, just hoping that a light will shine
Daylight saving time all the time on this block of mine
All the time with this Glock of mine
Swear to God man it ain't a rhyme, I grind for a piece of mind
Co-sign

[Chorus]

[Excerpt of Black Ice performing on Def Poetry]
"When you look at my brothers, what's your first impression?
 Does the sight of us leave you guessing, or do you understand the stressing?
 The aggression, the look of no hope on my niggas' faces
 like the Lord overlooked us when he handed down his graces
 You see embraces fall short on the numb tips of street entrepreneur fingers
 Stuck on the walls of the project halls where the coke smell still lingers
 External blingers is all we can be, cause on the inside we've been given nothing to shine on
 And a gig is harder to get than coke, so niggas get they grind on
 cause the TV tells us, aim high nigga, make all goals lateral
 But see that takes paper that we don't have so niggas put they souls up as collateral
 Now, some niggas reclaim 'em, some blame 'em, make an excuse to sell 'em
 But when a nigga goes from not doing to doing, what can you tell him?
 Not to be a nigga? Shit, I gots to be a nigga, that's how I pay the bills
 and I'ma do that whether I got to sling this coke or exploit these rhyme skills"

[Chorus]</pre>

[Intro: Miguel]
Righteous righteous
Wha~! Huh! Hehe

[Miguel]
Baby let me know it's mine
And I might put in overtime, yeah
Understandin' overnight
You know tonight, ain't a sober night
I wanna fuck right now, I wanna fuck right now
I wanna fuck right now, I wanna fuck yeah, I wanna fuck yeah

[ScHoolboy Q]
Yo, uhh
I wanna fuck right now, ayy
... In the bedroom geeked
while your clothes hang down, ayy
... Chillin' all day (all day)
Lovin' all night (all night)
Nice ass (nice ass) and your stomach all tight
If your money ain't right
I should be in your life
Put it down when your boyfriend know girl
Both hands where the sun wonât show girl
Meet you around four with the chauffeur
Keep a penny on top of my loafers
Keep a diamond on each of my tooth
Iâm gettin' money like athletes
It can, it can go down in the backseat
I know all your right spots without asking, hey

[Interlude: Miguel]
Baby let me know it's mine
And I might put in overtime
That's right, yeah understandin' overnight
You know that I, ain't the sober type

[Chorus 2X: Miguel + Kendrick Lamar]
I wanna fuck right now (right now) I wanna fuck right now (right now)
I wanna fuck right now (right now) I wanna fuck yeah, I wanna fuck yeah

[ScHoolboy Q]
Girl you bangin, you dynamite
Keep an arch in your back when you do it like
Fuck with me, you be luxury day and night
Got me trickin' on everything overpriced
Can I hit it and skip all the love?
Leave your square and come chill with a thug
Girl I'm privileged, you know how the time be changin'
Know I'm hittin' it right when your core be shakin'
Why you hangin' with niggas thatâs missin' payments?
Keepin' my dollars on top of dollars
Netflix and chill when itâs after hours
I should be in your room when you leave the shower
Hittin' them spots like you taught me 'bout 'em
Girl me and you got a lot in common
I'm the one you should call when you're done with clubbin'
Darlin' fuck all the talk, let me show you somethin', uhh

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Justine Skye]
Baby let me know it's mine
And I'ma put in overtime
Let's see, you're understandin' overnight
You know that I, ain't the sober type baby

Tell me what you want and I might do it
I've been tryna figure out your motive, yeah
Get it up, I put it down, I'ma show you how I do it
Wanna feel them lips all over me
But first I gotta know you're into me
Ain't tryna tease
But I'm not the kind of girl that be sleepin' around
Let me tell you how I'm feelin'
If you're a man, be a man, I'ma give you the world
You gon' have to wait a little
You gon' have to show me that you know my love is strong
Got my heart in the middle, I gotta trust you a little
If I say I will
I'm up for thrill

{*Schoolboy Q + Miguel ad-libs for 16 seconds*}

Album:  Setbacks
Song:   Rolling Stone
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Ab-Soul]
Drugs and girls
Uh, show me some love, my love
Last time I checked, you loved my love
Placed nothing above my love
If you leave, come back, like above your butt
No ifs, ands or buts
Yes I'm fishing, but I still wanna fill you up
"When the love runs high"
Hah, just when you thought enough was enough
I'm a kid in a museum and I just wanna touch
every part of your body, tie you up and get naughty

[Kendrick Lamar]
Hoe, we up in this party, HiiiPoWeR, money showers
All the ladies wanna kick it with Mr. Miyagi
Pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
I wanna touch up and down your spine
"When the love runs high"
Hmm, a perfect ten living on cloud nine

[Chorus]
I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time
Anything that can get me out of my mind
I'm a rolling stone who needs another home
especially "when the love runs high"
(Now everybody in the place)
Tote, tote, tote, tote
Tote, tote, tote, tote
(Do it till you can't feel your face)
Chug, chug, chug, chug
Chug, chug, chug, chug
(Everybody in the place)
Tote, tote, tote, tote
Tote, tote, tote, tote
(Do it till you can't feel your face)
Chug, chug, chug, chug
(Now stop, and just groove)

[ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, faded off life
See the dope man, time to get right
Uh, open up a Bud Light
Don Julio, Coronas, comas
Bad bitches, bad bitches
Calling bad bitches, bring your friend to be a witness
Uh, "when the love runs high"
Pfft, whatever that mean
Uh, need a shot, you the vaccine
You pumping through my veins, I'm a crack fiend
Uh, you're the crack
Uh, drive your ass all night, meet the chauffeur

[Jay Rock]
Bend you over in a Rover, it's over
Never sober, my cup runneth over
"When the love runs high"
Better know girl, you fucking with a soldier

[Chorus]

[Jay Rock]
Blunts and broads
Drinking on liquor that's hard, oh my God
Baby tryna grab my drawers
They call me Dozer, I knock down walls
Jose, that's my homie
He'll have you calling Earl in a hallway
"When the love runs high"
I gotta come down just to party
I'm turned up, maxed out
Willie Manchester, blow your back out
Baby girl, my advice, better back out
Got that dope stick, I'm the crack house

[Ab-Soul]
Listen ma, I got a role you can act out
and then like Prince' pants, get yo' ass out
I don't need a princess, I need a mistress
I'll stick a dick in a damsel in distress
'Soul~!

Artist: SZA f/ Kendrick Lamar 
Album:  Ctrl
Song:   Doves in the Wind
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[SZA]
Real niggas do not deserve pussy
Meaning it's more, you see right through walls
Ain't, talkin' about pussy
Meaning you deserve the whole box of chocolates
Come at me
Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him
Never without pussy
You know Jenny almost gave it all up for him
Never even pushed for the pussy
Where's Forrest now when you need him?
Talk to me, talk to me
Hey, ayy, hey

("Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches")

[Chorus: SZA]
Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, ride
Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, why, why
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride
You are now watching "MADtv"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas'll lose they mind for it, wine for it, dine for it (pussy)
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it (pussy!)
Double back handicap and go blind for it (pussy)
Pussy got endless prisoners, pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculatin' and good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks and the screw face when bae look
won't get you no pussy - I mean, the fake chains and the gold names
for insecure gon' reassure you not to get pussy (you not to get)
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy, see that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
SolÃ¡na, middle fingers up, speak your truth

[SZA]
You could never trivialize pussy
But a bum nigga like you would try it (pussy) I know what you really 'bout
High key, your {*censor*} is weak buddy (pussy)
It's only replaced by a rubber substitute, we ain't feelin' you (ahh)
Think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya
(Such a nice girl, SZA) I'm really tryna crack off 
on the headboard and bust it wide open for the right one
Is you that for me?
Cause if you that for me - heh
Like doves in the wind... hey hey
That pussy like doves in the wind... hey hey
Pussy like doves in the wind... hey hey
I will make you beg for it; I wanna see you call out

[Chorus]

[SZA - over Chorus]
Give you all of me and I won't stop, not, a little bit
Dangerous boy, I wanted to do it all
Un-fortunately you couldn't get your shit together</pre>

Artist: Skeme f/ Bryan Roberts, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Alive & Living
Song:   I Remember
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
HiiPOWER

Sox Gang

I'm wearing black pumas, hair like Kunte
Kendrick Lamar

'Bout eight of them in the studio
And the all want me

Fuck you niggas bruh

Skeme whaddup

[Verse 1: Skeme]
If I come off as unconcern, (yeah) please forgive me
I ain't even poured the sizzurp yet (nah)
I'm on this remy, if my phone going straight to voice mail
Bitch IÂm busy, I ain't got the time to tock
Every tick I'm repping my city (whoop)
Ten bottles at a time, this here is the life
And how I'm living might be wrong
But in this world what the fuck is right
It's just one rapper, 2 cups, 3 bitches blowing me
Heard it's 20 niggas in the VIP, then bitch you know it's me
I'm here for niggas go and do them bizz
Getting tired of hearing rappers just rapping the shit I live
All that I got is my all, that's exactly what I get
And I need my toilet paper every time I do my shit
Guess I should switch, cause I'm getting paid
Instead of worrying bout how I'm getting money, just do the same, bitch
The bright lights and people screaming my name
Fuck the money and the fame, bitch that's the reason I came

[Chorus]
I remember why we don't fuck with none of these niggas
I remember, I remember why we don't fuck with none of these niggas
I remember oh my, how the times change
Nothing's the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows the name
Oh my, how the times change
Nothing's the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows the name

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Driving on a freeway full of darkness
It's just me and plus my heart is cold
As an project carpet
You be coughing up commode
Full of shit see I was told
That only real niggas can harvest any future pot of gold
And look at you, I know you starving, see it's burning in your soul
And you look for me to console your emotions
I'm on the road and I'm joking with all my niggas
We laughing at you the feeling of victory is a gig
And I hope they catch you whenever you fall from the pedestal you was on
And don't get me wrong, you was in the zone of a lifetime
But the place you belong is the bottom
That's why I got a bullet for every ego or tuxedo
And some scenos, a combination that we know
Uh, tight rope, but I notice they walk a thin line
From having the disabilities of death, dumb and blind
Every time I recline, then remind myself
I would never die with pussy, less it was on my dick, pussy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bryan Roberts]
Staring out a benz window, thinking bout saying fuck it
I make it and spend it all
Middle finger for a budget
Got your rent off in my pocket, and spent off a piece of luggage
Got a lot of bad habits, with money, some shit I'm stuck with (yeah)
Nothing but dollars in my discussion, show my ass out in public
Cause motherfuckers love it, I hear (bitch)
Niggas out here plotting on the come up
I hold this gun up, then one of these coward niggas run up
My nigga dead, so for him I'm lighting my blunt up
I say "hustle for this rap bitch, I'm getting this from sun down to sun up"
I know it's niggas hating, praying I never make it
But jealous pussy I'm here, and I'm never leaving just face it (whoop)
Before one of these niggas take me out this motherfucking game
Promise I do my motherfucking thing
Do what the fuck I want, motherfucker lame
I just keep it 100, fuck breaking down for some change
Nigga I just stay the same

[Chorus]</pre>

Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Smoke DZA]
Uhh, right
Child of the ghetto, nobody explained it to me
I learned from the streets, no picture was painted for me
These niggas is frauds, they're not what they claiming to be
Got my 9-11 niggas with me, they craving for beef
Let the chopper sing to 'em like Franky Sinatra
High school, nigga probably got shoved in a locker
This for my niggas up top getting ready for lock up
These rap niggas weak, X 'em out like a pop-up
Known for making movies, give 'em an Oscar
Fucking low junky, part reason why they stock up
Hoes fall through the show, spending cake to watch us
Come home to you, kush God on her knockers
Uh, you're fucking right
Just another day, another Harlem night
These fucking weirdos, these niggas ain't bright
Playing round with DZA? Ball game, right

[Chorus: Smoke DZA]
I'm on my way, real on cake
Won't stop grinding till my crew all straight
I do, my dude, don't make me lose my cool
Knock 'em out the park, what you wan' do?
Nigga, it's ball game
That's a ball game chump
Uh, ball game
Nigga, the ball game's done, riiiight

[Kendrick Lamar]
In every inning, sure your career's ending
You niggas ain't winning, really you're short-winded
The bases is loaded, you ever notice
your spot in the game was took as I look at your team choking
Sore losers never can play as a {?}
Send shooters on your block skirting off on a scooter
I'm raising my stock with every hit record, look at my record
Your status will drop as soon as they message me in a session
Minor league coaches, we feed them bitches to vultures
You posing as a poser, we post your death on a poster
Your highlight is getting closer to stardom, we never stalling
We starve 'em and tire mark 'em in the dust so you can watch 'em
In God trust, I'm probably tied up with a cheerleader
Just your luck, you fucked around and let a queer lead ya
Time's up, you play softer than Damian
We aim it at you cranium, and leave fragments over the stadium, what?!

Artist: Smoke DZA f/ Mara Hruby, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  The Hustler's Catalog
Song:   How Far We Go (Uptown 81)
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Smoke DZA]
Right, gather round hustlers, that's if ya still living
and get on down with this T.H.C. vision

The last of a dying breed, too many wack artists
So tell 'em PaRappa the Rapper niggas rap harder
Like being garbage, some type of disease
I take 'em out they misery, make it harder to breathe
Ain't no problem to me, call me Father MC
Pay homage to a God, bitch fall on your knees
Hood booger, wannabe housewife gassed off nini
Hot sadiddy needy, try to emulate the TV
But this real, fuck how you feel
Call of Duty mode with these verses, lot of kills
First niggas doubted the flow, now how you feel?
If this was back in the days, you'd get a lot of gills
Gimme mines, I really rhyme, yep, really I'm
one of the illest niggas doing it, or these niggas is losing it, silly minds
They try to style on a New York nigga
like my flow ain't cold like a New York winter
I don't stunt, I regulate, seen empires separate
Best friends kill best friends every day
for petty sake, not even heavyweight, it's never good
There's a Rich Porter story in every hood, DZA

[Chorus: Smoke DZA] + (backing vocals by Mara Hruby)
No matter how far we go
We forever be real, we'll never fold
Know my niggas stay down, we all we know
We gotta get it so we live it
Just remember what we do and won't stop

[Kendrick Lamar]
My turbulence put a burden on young herbs
Once it's cracking, it's a chain reaction minus Yung Berg
I'm on the verge of excellence, kill 'em off with no evidence
Take a shot at the Exorcist, then X 'em out with these words
Panoramic views be tumbling out of my mind
This ain't 1992, bullets tumbling out no nines
Big AKs like Alicia Keys abbreviated
and nowadays niggas stand behind 'em like Clive Davis
Clyde Drexler, before the hood got dribbled niggas right up on that stretcher
An understatement said that K. Lamar was under pressure
Don't press your luck when I'm pressed for time
cause when the press get this verse, they sure to press rewind
The president's prayer can't save us in my cul-de-sac
There's codeine, crack and Cognac, enough violence to keep the Devil smiling
while we whyling on them corners with the ropes and rats
Nigga build a trap house, hope his homie don't run his trap
See the Feds and tap out, that's wrestler shit
Don't rest your case as a gangster just cause you wrestled your bitch
We move in silence like the potato tip when we riding
And we ride rotten, two choppers found thirty sirens
You ain't been where I been, I know where I'm going, and life's a bitch
I know that she hoeing, I know that I'm sewing what I reap
And know that I'm flowing like water from sea or water from creek
And if I don't speak, I know you ain't growing
cause I'm a leader, respect it when you see him
Accepted by your new bitch, your old bitch and your B.M.
Y'all always on that B.S., and P.S. I'm taking all things
I'm taking off first, this G6 is on its way, what's up?!
Kendrick, Kendrick Lamar

Artist: Taylor Swift f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Bad Blood (Remix) {S}
Song:   Bad Blood (Remix)
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
Cause baby now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
Cause baby now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, uh.. uh, hey!
I can't, take it back, look where I'm at (uh)
We was on D like DOC, remember that? (remember that?)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me similar, Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to, critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more, better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more
AHH~!!

[Interlude: Taylor Swift]
Ohh, it's so sad to, think about the good times
You and Iiiii

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Cause baby now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
Cause baby now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, uh, hey!
Remember when you tried to write me off? (uh-huh)
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumpin' through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now (hahaha)

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Taylor Swift] + (Kendrick Lamar) + {both}
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it, go)
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes (yeah)
You say sorry just for show (uh-huh)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts... mm
{If you love like that} Blood runs coooold~!

[Chorus] - 2X w/ ad-libs</pre>

Album:  BUSH
Song:   I'm Ya Dogg
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg w/ Charlie Wilson ad-libs]
Baby, I come runnin'; baby, I come runnin'
Just keep me comin', and I come runnin'
Cause I'm your dawg; baby, I'm your dawg
So whenever you call, I come runnin'

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg - singing]
You ain't listenin', so you can talk to me
Don't listen to him; a body like that ain't hard to feed
Cause girl I'll eat you up, all in a couple of seconds
Girl I'll eat you up; it's when you realize you're in Heaven
like how'd you get there? Baby what you doin' in this chair?
Couldn't let you sit there; you need help, somebody should get there
You see girl, time is like money, both of which men loathe
Spend them both with me, and then for sure you'll know

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Let's roll up some more weed
Give me one of those black bottles {"M-M-M"}
Let's just pretend those two bitches'll come over here, man
Real talk {"M-M-M"}

Uhh, she's impressed by a fat boy
Cadillac, weed, pistol on his lap boy
Home run hitter, thought I was a batboy
Search warrant for the crib, you better get a map for it
Paid for, meanin' I ain't gotta rap for it
She a alley oop, I tap it off the backboard
Hustlin', baby what you lookin' for? Just ask for it
Blue Ferrari, I'm the envy of the task force
Impeccable suits, as I run with my dogs
Pinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job
Dogg Pound niggas, and we came to fight
I was several million up before it came to light
Now they callin' me the truest one to ever do it
Status symbol for the pimps, now enjoy the music
Smoked out like a player and you know the name
Break a bitch quick, really, biggest in the game {"Maybach Music"}

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I got, Rottweiler in tube sock
Pitbull, lock on your neck, kiss it and you'll die
Boxer, you take mine's off then hallelujah
Shando, count my blessings, spin around two times
Freaky, freak like it's the 80s
Fuckin' explicit, radio probably say we
should tone it, down with the clean version
Dirty, but in public you're like teen virgin
I like it, make me realize my vices
Enticin', flower bombin' all on your privates
Private, meetin' inside your bedroom
Head in that Maybach boomin', thank God for leg room
It's a trophy in that pussy, I'ma cum in first place
I'ma cum in first place, cum in, cum in first place
I'm your D-O-double-G and I need more, pedigree
What it D-O? Puppy chow, I've been grown and so off the leash, hoe

[Intro: Swizz Beatz] + (Styles P)
(Let's go, Swime)
Oh y'all thought you wasn't gon' get that Kendrick and that L.O.X. smoke, huh? (Yeah)
Y'all thought you wasn't gon' get that LOX and Kendrick smoke?
That Styles P, that Jada, that Kendrick (Yeah, yeah)
Oh y'all think it's games being played around here, huh? (Oww!)
Well they not - wooooo! Lighters in the air~!

[Jadakiss] + (Swizz Beatz) + {Styles P}
The damage that we do is severe (oh!)
The reinvention of the fresh brand new every year (goddamn!)
{Them bullets hit him in his blood and flesh flew in the air}
{We put that work on commercial, we flew in the Lear}
I lift the bar and the weights then I'm doin' the stairs
They say the Lord only knows what I do to my peers (work)
{Tryna smoke, sell juice and pursue my career} (c'mon)
{So I keep a tight circle, I don't move with the squares}
Rock a rugby like Puba, put two in the air
If you ain't qualified to kill, you should move to the rear (damn)
{I'm from Yonkers, had to learn to conquer my fears}
{In the foreign, had to learn to conquer the gears} (ladies and gentlemen)
It's the kick drum, yeah it's attached to the snare
I turn the gat to the back then I'm crackin' veneers
{You niggas stagnated, on the block trappin' for wears} (wooooo!)
I'm in a mansion upstate out back with the deers (talk to 'em, Kendrick)
{Nigga, nigga}

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody back up (back up, back up, back up)
Man down (man down, man down, man down) back the fuck up
Don't play with me, I'll do you somethin' dirty
You talk to me crazy, I'll do you somethin' dirty
How I feel lately, I'll do you somethin' dirty (I'll do you somethin' dirty)
I'll wake up the neighbors, comin' through bright and early
Whoa!

[Swizz] That's where it's at!

[Styles P] + (Swizz Beatz) + {Jadakiss}
Oww! Cartel ties and dope bars (ayy)
{Life is a movie and death is the co-star}
Mechanics to the game
{Band of trail foreigns in the lane} If they heard that the driver is gettin' coke off
{We be in the part of the party that get roped off} (work, ayy)
Mingle with the plug or the judge and knock 'em both off
{Questions that we askin' ourselves, havin' a smoke off} (say what, say what?)
Spendin' money that's unaccounted for (ahh~!)
{If you scared to party with gangstas} What you around us for? (Woo!)
{We do what we want my nigga} We get around the law
{Yeah, it's bubble whips and square links} (say what?)
L.O.X. get respect nigga cause fear stinks
{A chair at the table} It's the commission {a rare thing}
The beat come on, it's us nigga, you hear the kings
{We still smell money in here, Frank}
Rap's like the dice game nigga {we 'bout to clear bank} (let's go)

[Chorus]

[Outro: Styles P] + (Swizz Beatz)
This is a L.O.X., Swizz product
If it's ice up in Heaven, we know Pic got us
It's love up there, we know Pic got us
L.O.X. my nigga, you don't know shit 'bout us
Double R my nigga, you don't know shit 'bout us
D-Block my nigga, you don't know shit 'bout us
Ask Swizz, he'll tell you we keep a clique 'bout us
(Goddammit!)

Artist: Talib Kweli f/ Curren$y, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Prisoner of Consciousness
Song:   Push Thru
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus]
High rises, day breaks
Clouds hide the sun's rays
Quicksand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
even on the bad days
It's darkest before light
I'm gonna push through

[Curren$y]
Turbo-charged bars
Slot cars on track, falling off
Game stars in these rap wars
Ain't nothing Band-Aids won't cover
Touring with 7D coverage, live bands, two buses
My own cash, no budget, no major label fundings
Jets baby, we went from crawling to walking to running
You can't say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audis, hurting y'all with kicks, I'm the Transporter
Think about it, never mind, you ain't gotta
I'm already on some whole other, word to your motherfucking self
Nobody else gon' do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then, somebody will off you help
But they ain't doing nothing till they really see you tryna do something
I ain't bluffing, kush puffing on you jive turkeys
Stuffing stockings with these gifts
Audible applaudables, homie take a whiff, yeah

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
Yeah, when you a man, action is what's expected, nothing is spoken on
Producer, never got time for no excuses, you gotta go beyond
My flow is tom-foolery
I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
I beautifully exude the vibe that's free of ambiguity
Your goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It's coonery, it's lunacy
Let's make a plan, only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak with body language fluently
She make it rain, when I'm on fire she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home
like I broke the glass and let myself in, fighting for freedom
like the people in Tunisia and spread through Sudan and Egypt
This the music for the movement, the score to your achievements
Never join 'em so you gotta beat 'em, it's carpe diem, hey, (hey), yeah

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh huh, yeah, like kindergarteners, my vision's bothered
by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya, the starving'll speed on ya
Stampede on ya, impede on your pockets, then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending established with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in
to society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
your seat belts twice, when I rolled them dice I crapped
so many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That's what my mental say, but my physical's been detached
I'm on some other shit, like fuck the government, I'm higher rankings
Where's the mothership? I made a covenant that I was changing
But my luck has been quite disgusting when reality tainted
Where the fuck you been? Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress? Nigga, which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick, know life's a bitch when you ain't focussed
Nigga, I'm focussed

[Chorus]</pre>

Artist: Tech N9ne f/ Kendrick Lamar, Â¡Mayday!, Kendall Morgan
Album:  Something Else
Song:   Fragile
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Wrekonize & Bernz]
You said you'd never ever break... down
But here I am sweeping... pieces off of the ground
You said you'd never, ever play... to crowds
But I've seen you hoping to play songs to them now
I've spent all night long scared of tomorrow, I broke my alarm
Everything is almost lost, pick it up slow, before it's gone...

[Chorus: Wrekonize & Kendall Morgan]
We're fragile
(Wish I'd have known)
I never thought I'd be so fragile
(You're not alone)
If it didn't break before, it's about to
(We've been here before)
I don't ever want to change
I'm fragile
I don't ever want...
I don't ever...

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Some of the people appointed to give an opinion
Never do get it
I want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and... die
N9na be givin the remedy and why?
Critics are really the enemy and I
Can't stand the way they slam today's gifted
Effin' incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay
This jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
I'm the N9ne I'm a look very mean
When a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
By the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto.
Cause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin'
He's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks I'm a despise
Never do try to listen
It's real - I'm mad
Clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize now with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad.
You don't really get why I'm so pissed? Understand this:
I'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shit, yes I'm

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me that I'm famous
Tell me that my name is
Big as Venus Jupiter and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know you're heinous
Tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
Unconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favourite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
That's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'
On this pen, on this pad
Tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
Stop...
Puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
Drop...
This is more than you, and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin' and abusin'
What I call the realest comin' from a student
Told myself to use a poem as an UZI
Empty magazine, I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'
That was nicotine, I'm bout to smoke 'em all
And journalists involved should've known my music

Artist: Tech N9ne f/ Kendrick Lamar, Krizz Kaliko, Oobergeek
Album:  All 6's and 7's
Song:   I Love Music
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Tech N9ne]
The-the, the reason that I'm breathing
Seeping heat gets me cheese while I'm eating in Bad Season
Was deep in beef and was needing some beats to release in evenings
instead of me being up and bleeding with thieves and heathens with keys
and obstacles, made it possible for the flow, gotta be profitable
Yo Tech's audible, his inarguable product popped, it was plausible
God is so, good for giving me music
Lifting, getting me through when I was fixing to lose it
Dudes hit Big Scoob's shit and repping the blue tip
Fool's skipped, it was {?}, we jumped in the two-whip
Full clips for who stick the homie for true grip
My crew, thanks to music, we all living through it
Got me out of the ghetto, got me mucho dinero
in Cozumel Mexico, shorts and Jordans and a sombrero
This gift ain't given from a devil, so settle
Come and get this rebel music that's hot as a kettle, pendejo
Saved my life, paid my lights, made my wife say "bye bye"
Gave my night babes, I like prayed my mic
would never fade, forever slayed, days I write
My cheddar raise up better, phase way high-hyped
My music's one reason I always get to lay my pipe
The reason Tech Nina can comfortably say "night night"
Blessed me with original flow, so hey, why bite?
I hear, I feel, I live, listen and learn, I like

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
I love music (yeah, I love)
I love music (for real)
I love music (and I need)
I love music (to feel)
I love music (go and play it)
I love music (yeah, know what I'm saying?)
I love music (my love)
I love music (know what I'm saying?)

[Oobergeek]
Automatic when I do this, manually
Daily, monthly, annually, I get a step closer to being the coolest
Acoustic got me fooling, about to lose it, ooh shit
Jump in the grind, and my homie Mike produced it - that's music partna
I'm just a poet with incredible rhythm
Words arranged will let you know he has incredible in him
I don't mean to toot my own horn, but toot-toot, ha-ha
I laugh because it's easier than do-re-mi-fa-so-la
ti-do, we know he go {?} on that C note
and he can play a C note with that B note, I'm talking truth
And I got stories that will show you that it's walking proof
A thousand miles of it and I can show you what I'm walking through
Music ain't a hobby, it's an organ of my body
that the creator provided back in January of '92
So don't you dare say good music skipped my generation
Your hating ain't nothing but motivation for these compilations, Oob'

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
I love music (yeah, it feeds me)
I love music (I need)
I love music (you feel me?)
I love music (know what I'm saying?)
I love music (yeah, it's my thang)
I love music (know what I'm saying?)
I love music (and I love it)
I love music (yeah, go ahead)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Music is my life, the reason why I write
Like Edgar Allen Poe on the beat, like a parasite
You thought a parachute made my flow just fall out the sky
then you fell apart into a body part no one would buy
Nobody tried my limits cause they're afraid of heights
They ambition weak or gravity let 'em die
I let you live until a nigga compose a rhyme
then it's like a rhino in your ass every time
Time and time again I treat my pen like the pen
Bars harder than Pelican Bay and I been
serving a life sentence since the day I was ten
Nine times out of ten, you only ten songs deep
before you leap into a pool of sharks then swim
That's an analogy on the way I do casualties
And I do this shit casually, before the first end
I'll be in the Hall of Fame with my picture framed friend

[Krizz Kaliko]
And if it wasn't for (my music)
Yeah, I wouldn't be standing here
If it wasn't for (my music)
You wouldn't have nothing to hear, yeah
And I love

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
I love music (I need it to live)
I love music (it's almost a gift)
I love music (yeah, and I love it)
I love music (this time I'ma be quiet, shh)
... (and I love)
I love music (showing I love it)
I love music (whoa-oh)

Artist: T.I. f/ B.o.B, Kendrick Lamar, Kris Stephens
Album:  Memories Back Then {S}
Song:   Memories Back Then
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

{*Kris Stephens harmonizes for first 21 seconds*}

[T.I.]
Ay, in my apartment a long time ago I knew a bad bitch but she was kinda slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us; she let me finger fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train, she wanna hang with us, we want one thang
Just penetratin that throat dawg - she choke on it like smoke dawg
But whenever I fucked up my re-up, in a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce and then blow a blunt of that reefer
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers, pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she could page to put a "69" and I know it's time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her, "Why you always give ya ass up?
I mean damn these hoes get paid, all you do is get laid, this shit don't add up"
She said "Tip, all I wanna do is feel love, even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it then never call back, I still fuck"
And that's fucked up cause she's so trill, I need somethin, she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride, nigga guess where we go chill?
About fo' years she held dope and my fo'-pound 'til it go down
I remember shawty, she stayed down, I won't say her name cause she married now

[Chorus: Kris Stephens]
When the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my hea-aaaaaaaaaaaaaad
Oh-oh-ohhhh, all of the things that I did back then
Ohhhh, when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've ha-aaaaaaaaaaaaaad
Oh-oh-ohhhh, all of the things that I did back then

[B.o.B]
Yo, yo uhh
She would always turn heads when she fall through, she would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day, but she the chick all the niggaz tried to talk to
But when it came to me she had a thing for me, when we kicked it she rolled up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class, post up in the cut steady watchin just to see if the police comin
We got close over time her and I, right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17, I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was goin back and forth with these flights, another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches she'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two, wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us but she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few, huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this lil' chick that caught my eye, I told her "Hurry up, meet me at the room"
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive, and my common sense neglected
And two months later next thing I know I got a text that said "I'm pregnant"
And you can almost bet she kept it, and that's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine, I went and got paternity tested
Damn!

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Wait, hold up, is that you? With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 305 had gave me high five when I said I'm in hot pursuit
You said "I won't ride until Kendrick drive a new Monte Carlo that cruise"
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv but no freestyle'll ever do
You're lookin for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You're overlookin every nigga that ain't quite ready
To make it rain on you like about to break a levee - HOLD UP! That pussy petty
Yeah yo' nails did, yo' hair did, yo' cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer, her new primadonna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine hoe, tried to make some time hoe
But I ain't got the time or the patience to stop and wait in line hoe
Her dreams holds Versace, she fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggaz, fuck you and Mitt Romney
I'm grown now, I'm on my own now, I'm po-o-o-oppin
Change my phone now, when I get home now I got o-o-o-options
Fast forward, wait, is that you? With them big ol' thighs after school?
And yo' three kids and three baby daddies and car note that's overdue?
I know

[Chorus]

Artist: Trae Tha Truth f/ Big K.R.I.T., B.o.B, Bun B, Gudda Gudda, 
        Jadakiss, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Mark Morrison, Tyga 
Album:  I'm On 2.0 single
Song:   I'm On 2.0
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro: Mark Morrison]
Return of the Mack 
Return of the Mack
Return of the Mack 
You know that I'll be back (oww!)
Return of the Mack (once again) 
Return of the Mack (Pump up the world)
Return of the Mack (Watch - my - flow) 
You know that I'll be back 

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Today is the day, I get out on my feet
Remove them chains, that's shackled on me
Press my luck, stop fuckin with them hoes that cluck
Cause the same motherfuckers the one that got me stuck
Tryna use me up, 'til my tank on E
Then leave me stranded, scramblin in these streets
For a dollar a day, until my pockets is straight
Soon as you move out the hood them niggaz holla ya fake
Make 'em swallow the bass, from the kicker
I'd rather be a dead man than a +N.I.G.G.E.R.+
I'd rather roll chrome rims than a swisha
I gotta make moves, I cain't hang witcha
They used to be the fly shit back in '95
But now I want a crib and a car I can drive
And ain't nobody out there help me cause I'm grown
Gotta leave them childish games alone
Nigga I'm on

[Trae Tha Truth]
Chea! I'm in the hood, still prayin for a piece of plate
I know he on his way, I'm hopin he don't make it late
I'm up the bat, I just hope I make it to the plate
I'm Babe Truth, you can tell 'em I'm one of the greats
Used to shoot for the stars now my aim locked
I'm Tha Truth nigga something that your name not
A thousand watts ain't a thing that I cain't shock
And ain't a wrist or a chain that I cain't rock
Tell 'em I'm on, somethin like city lights
I used to be out they sights, tinted like city nights
Now a nigga be city to city on plenty flights
You can tell 'em I put on for my city in plenty fights
Tell 'em I ain't gon' lose, they heated like I'm a tan man
'Bout to throw em in this drop with no ceilings so I can fan 'em
Pull up on the mic (ah-HAAAAAH!), same color as the Phantom 
And jump out on haters just to tell 'em I couldn't stand 'em

[Jadakiss]
Yeah, yeah
I'm on top of my game yo 
The OG Grand Daddy Kush, cocaine flow
I'm about that +Cash+, not that +Tango+
Head shots, dump a whole clip in ya Kangol (yep)
Claim to be a real nigga, we know you ain't though (naw)
I be in the hood, all the places you cain't go (haha)
Visuals, you can see the pictures I paint yo
Residuals, I just put it all in the bank yo, it's pitiful
Hoes only after your bankroll
Stay off the phone, watch out for the plain clothes (Narcs')
Yeah I rep my set, I ain't in the gang though (D-Block)
And I protect my neck, I carry the thing yo (yep)
I'm on the same shit that the boss is on
Do it for those in the feds, up north or gone (Wood)
I'm on a winning streak, I done got my losses on
It's ironic cause even when I'm off I'm on
Yeah, I'm on, uh, what!

[Chorus: Mark Morrison]
I'm on, I'm on
(WHOOOOOOOOOOOA-OOO-OO-Oo-ohh)
I'm on, I'm on
(WHOOOOOOOOOOOA-OOO-OO-Oo-ohh)
I'm on, I'm on
(WHOOOOOOOOOOOA-OOO-OO-Oo-ohh)
I'm on, ooh yeah-hey-ee
(WHOOOOOOOOOOOA-OOO-OO-Oo-ohh)
I'm on

[J. Cole]
I'm 'bout to cop the Porsche
Eternally grateful for the support, made the cover of The Source
Flashback to the Ports, the city of no remorse
Where they shootin back and forth like they playin H.O.R.S.E.
May the force, be with you, bullet hit you
You bleed then I bleed with you
Mama please when you grieve damn I grieve with you
This a preview I see you in the summer
My new shit dumber, I'm on

[Kendrick Lamar]
Life at the bottom is devastating
You're hardly ever debated, the party is obligated
by suckers that wanna be you and never live in the matrix
And never ever related to struggle and dedication
Your hustle is nominated, anonymous then you faded
The promises that a victory lap is surely awaited
They vomited everytime that a rapper's annihilated
Just wish them happy belated - Fuck you~! I made it, I'm on

[B.o.B]
Tokyo to Amsterdam, Denver to LA (yea)
Minutes turn to hours and hours to pay (yea)
The days turn to nights but the nights never change
It's funny how "time is money" used to be a turn of phrase
But now it's company policy, I'm no spokesperson (No doe)
No tricks, no gimmicks, no coercion (Hol' up)
And they say, "Bob, man it's good to have you back" (what?!)
But I say, "I have been here, where the fuck have y'all been at?"

[Tyga]
HAH! Thinkin how Pac lived at 22 that's '93
I was four, now I'm 22 on tour
One-two shots of my life, barely hold on
But I'm drawn to this feeling of adrenaline
When mic's on, lights on, and they gon' applaud
Young nigga, Versace they never seen before
And they gon' watch me, wanna copy shit I got on
I'm too fly, I ain't got a flaw
Tell the law we above the law
God bless, amen, every lost soul 
and the group so good went solo
Globetrottin, now I'm blowin up like an afro
Nigga thought you knew what I do
Rollin through ya area, Double R coupe
Penthouse level, now we only party on the roof
Bitch I'm a rebel so I move how I wanna move
Last King, YMCMB {*BOOM!*}

[Gudda Gudda]
Used to run around the hood pickin honeys up
Now I'm doin shows 'round the world pickin money up
Used to be slept-on like a pillow
Went from trappin in a rental to rappin on instrumentals
Now it's money on my mental and women get sentimental, huh
It's cause the flow is sweet as a pack of Skittles, nah?
Yellow, gold, yellow diamonds in the middle now
Stand up nigga, I was never known to settle down

[Bun B]
Well as the world spins around and around on its axis
Boys flip from town to town with the package
Stuffin bills and pounds of browns in a mattress
Sendin clowns underground for practice
The fact is everybody wanna be the king with the crown (crown)
But never in the battle when the drama goes down (down)
Easy to be the boss from behind the wall
But we gon' see who really down when it's time to brawl (c'mon)
Cause you gotta be careful about the image you portraying (huh)
You gotta show love to where you from all day
And when the goin gets rough, don't get to goin, get to stayin
Put it down for yo' people with no delayin, know I'm sayin?

[Outro: Mark Morrison]
I'm on...
I'm on... ooh yeah-hey-ee
I'm on</pre>

Artist: A Tribe Called Quest f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  We Got It From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service
Song:   Conrad Tokyo
Typed by: Gemini_20502K@Yahoo.com

[Verse One: Phife Dawg]
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo pistachio
Just done mash a show, Dawg is off sabbatical
Rather watch the Nixon shit than politicians politic
CNN and all this shit, gwaan yo, move with the fuckery
Trump and the SNL hilarity
Troublesome times kid, no times for comedy
Bloodclaat you doin'? bullshit you spewin'
As if this country ain't already ruined
In lieu of these mumbling, fumbling swearing they're the greatest
Online they debate us if we different then we're haters
We ended our hiatus the dogs looking for food
The nucleus is here now (OOOH!!!!)

[Verse Two: Kendrick Lamar]
Toleration for devastation got a hunger for sin
Every nation abomination let the coroner in
Crooked faces red and blue laces for the color of men
Just embrace it and die alone song of revelation
Reverends and cattles racing, devils and demons and deuteronomy
Fumigate our economy 'lluminate broken dreams
And manifest all insanity, look around
Sayonara tomorrow it's just blood on the ground

[Chorus: A Tribe Called Quest] (Kendrick Lamar)
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo pistachio!!!
(Sayonara tomorrow it's just blood on the ground)
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo pistachio!!!
(Sayonara tomorrow it's just blood on the ground)
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo pistachio!!!
(Sayonara tomorrow it's just blood on the ground)
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo pistachio!!!
(Sayonara tomorrow it's just blood on the ground)
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo pistachio!!! 
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo pistachio!!! 
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo pistachio!!! 
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo pistachio!!! 

[Music Interlude]

[Outro: A Tribe Called Quest]
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo pistachio!!! 
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo pistachio!!! 
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo pistachio!!! 
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo pistachio!!!

--- L.A. ---
Artist: Ty Dolla $ign f/ D&D, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Free TC
Song:   L.A.
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Sample]
"Stone-hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone-hard, machine gun
Bulletproof glass"

[Chorus: D&D]
L.A., can't believe I found love in the city of L.A
L.A., it's the city of angels, they can take you anywhere
In L.A., L.A., L.A., L.A., we found, found love in L.A., L.A., L.A., L.A
We found love

[Ty Dolla $ign]
In the city of the gang bang
Yeah, we still dying over red and blue strings
Chuck my set up and it feel good
Cause don't nobody love you more than your neighborhood
We always had bitches, we don't love those
Grew up around the gangsters and the cutthroats
Be careful where you at, you might get bust on
Yeah, all my South Central niggas, Inglewood, twist your fingers up
Compton and Watts, Eastside, always turning up
Bad bitches up at Greystone and Supper Club
Tell 'em where we're from like

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
God, let me right my wrongs, God, let me write this song
God in the middle with a mark
Let me hit a pawn shop, momma said we need a loan
God, let me dedicate this to the 80% that ain't never coming home
God, let me know you exist
In a city where a hundred hollow-tips get thrown
I'm off that Centennial
Fuckin' at the party, nigga, at the party, we fade ten or more
My hood came thinkin' we yellin', "We in this bitch"
Then we yellin', "We in your bitch"
Or you tellin' all of us our dwellin' inside of 2Pacolypse, thug life
And we off that whoopty-whoopty-whoop
And we in that hoopty with the two choppers
So we're guaranteed to shoot
Lock us in the L.A. County zoo
Watch us eat a bear alive and, ooh this feels so good to keep it true
This feels so good, I'm keepin' you
Hope I'm teachin' you all the lessons I learned
When I made that turn off the 110
Watch that marijuana just burn
This shit just make you wanna just sin
See that Staples Center high yearnin' if the Lakers get me a win
I'm gon' liquor shot in memory of Pac, Makaveli live again
Bitch, I'm in L.A. yeah, yeah, motherfucker

[Chorus]

--- Yeah Right ---

Artist: Vince Staples f/ KUCKA, Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Big Fish Theory
Song:   Yeah Right
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

Ohh!

[Chorus: Vince Staples]
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeeeeeah - oww!)

[Vince Staples]
Is your house big? Is your car nice?
Is your girl fine? Fuck her all night?
Is you well paid? Are your shows packed?
If your song played, would they know that?
How the thug life? How the love life?
How the workload? Is your buzz right?
Do the trap jump? Is the plug right?
Got your head right? Boy yeah right

[Chorus]

[Vince Staples]
Pretty woman wanna slit the wrist
Pretty woman wanna be a rich man's bitch
Pretty women want a couple kids
Pretty women want a new ass, new lips
Pretty women wanna push a Benz
Come correct and she won't let you in
Thumbin' through a check, she gets it in
Diamonds on your neck, is them pretend?

[Chorus]

[Interlude: KUCKA]
Got an enemy that changes 
Dependin' what direction, you're fa-cin'
Got an enemy that tells you 
What block and what division, you're placed, in
You pretend to get a better idea 
About the lifestyle, you're cha-sin'
Keep pretendin', make it real 
Until every cell replaced, erased

[Kendrick Lamar]
Pop 'til it's vacant
Pop 'til the wrist pop, pop 'til he shakin'
Pop like four on the floor been in rotation, no allegation
Popular demand, I understand my name is only for conversation
New York nigga be like "deadass"
L.A. nigga be like "on the dead homies"
I was off the porch like Fed-Ex
211, got bread on me~!
K-Dot twilight the zeitgeist
Roll like fried rice and tempura shrimp, uh
Temporary pimp, nah, don't remember them
Just canary yellow gem, jumpin' out the fuckin' gym, uh
Swang like new Dana Dane, I ride dirty, uh
Paid like two Damon Wayans, retire early, uh
Fade like shadows, the stallion, the cattle
A bitch's decision for you is narrow
Collision, the money, and fame, the pharaoh
The physic, the chemist, the lame
Collateral for Kendrick whenever exchange
Compatible for riches with more to gain
I said nigga yeah right, I don't fair fight but I bear fight
Lookin' for my next roadkill for the headlight
Hangin' on my last four kills for the highlights
My life, Hiii life, high five, bye bye

[Outro: Vince Staples]
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeeeeeah!)</pre>

Album:  Starboy
Song:   Sidewalks
Typed by: Cedmaster3K
 
[The Weeknd]
Uh-uh, uh, uh
Uh-uh, uh, yea, yea
 
I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
Cause too many people think they made me
Well if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever son'd me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never makin' money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pullin' up in Aventadors
Just know we been grindin' on them sidewalks
 
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my liiife
They don't ever lie...
Sidewalks saved my liiife
They showed me all the signs...
 
[Interlude: Daniel Wilson]
They don't, let, me down
But they lead me on
And they don't, let, me do-own
But they lead, me onnnnn
And they lead, me on
 
[Kendrick Lamar]
Say say say, I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say say say, we hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae-bae
Say say say, trippin' off dyke and my name strike with payday
Say say say, flippin' blue lightnin', tightenin', strapped with AK
Say say say, OG one told me one, show me one eight ways
How to segue, pussy, power, profit in headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent or life intimate with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it, awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a +Starboy+, the sun and the moon and star boy
Astronomer, anonymous; I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us are probably fucked
she mollied up, I tallied up all the parts boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (head) head, head, more head (head)
Oh God, bless the dead (yup) I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokers off to bed, I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock, I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I want a quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

--- No More Parties in L.A. ---
Artist: Kanye West f/ Kendrick Lamar 
Album:  WAVES
Song:   No More Parties in L.A.
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Johnny "Guitar" Watson sample]
"La di da dahh, dahh" (I like this flavor)
"La da da da di da dahh, lahh"

[Interlude: Junie Morrison sample]
"Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far"

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No more parties in L.A.
Please baby, no more parties in L.A., uhh
No more parties in L.A.
Please baby, no more parties in L.A., uhh
No more {"Los Angeles"}
Please {"Shake that body, party that bod-"}
Please {"Shake that body, party that body"}
Please {"Shake that body, party that body"}

[Kanye West]
Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan

[Kendrick Lamar]
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Umm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots, a country girl that love Hollywood
Momma used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pourin' and niggas swarmin' your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras, this shit unanimous for you
It's damagin' for you, I think
that pussy should only be holdin' exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're makin' him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said "Baby spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealin' with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is"
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, movin' units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said "K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet"
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Scary...
Scary...
No more parties in L.A.
Please baby, no more parties in L.A.

[Kanye West]
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinkin' back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks man, you preachin' to the choir
Any rumor you heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my, niggas with babies by, bitches
That use they, kids as meal, tickets
Not knowin' the, disconnect from the, father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do? Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way bitch
Somedays I'm in my Yeezys, somedays I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
A 38-year-old, 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam
Thank God for me! {"Los Angeles"}
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop, dro-dro-dro-drop it like RoboCop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money
And as far as +Real Friends+, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker {*echoes*}

[Larry Graham sample]
"I just keep on lovin' you baby
And there's no one else I know can take your place-ace-ace"

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Please, no more parties in L.A.
Please baby, no more parties in L.A., uhh
No more parties in L.A.
Please baby, no more parties in L.A., uhh
No more parties in L.A.
Please baby, no more parties in L.A., uhh

[Interlude]

Artist: XV f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  Zero Heroes
Song:   Textbook Stuff
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus 2X: Imogen Heap "Speeding Cars" sample]
"There there baby, it's just textbook stuff
 It's in the ABC of growing up"

[XV]
Yeah, three women raised me, Famous Footwear paid me
Not enough to blow up, but showed up cause I ain't fucking lazy
And teachers thought I was dumb or crazy, or both
With hopes of being a Nas or Jay-Z, I slumped
in my chair and my grades, my hair wasn't waves
Being fly was priority to the lowest
I would stand on my desk just to see the world in a different way
The Dead Society of a Poet, homie I'm focussed
But that's something that a dude can't prove
I mean fam, I was damn near invisible at school
So I banged for a minute cause all my niggas was Cripping
Just me and two of my dudes, blue man crew
Had dreams of doing things they say that you can't do
cause everything ain't black and white 'less you chew bamboo
So I was after big bills like a toucan do
All the while my mom asking why I'm truant at school, she said

[Chorus 2X]

[XV]
Yeah, uh, so why ain't I go college?
My momma's ultimatum made me say that I know I got it
My niggas said, V's bugging
Stay on your computer software debugging, but we holding hardware cause we thugging
Now they in the trap house with some guns that they done borrowed
and all this snow/Aldis Snow, I call it "Infant Sorrow"
With plans to reach the end even if I had to start slow
Sold CDs in the mall, making dough like Sbarro
Then I left the hood like, fuck it, don't need the cargo
They banking I don't do "Well", and I don't mean Fargo
But even when you leave, somehow it still try to follow
Baby brother took a charge harder than LeBron and Rondo
Tryna keep his head up while his eyes are in the Bible
cause they a mind that's idle is a Devil's toy aisle
My nephew looking at me cause his daddy is his idol
I looked at him, told him sit down, this information is vital, look

[Chorus 2X]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Living my life like I'm living right
In the midst of a fire pit, the gangbanging and violence
is the sweetest song, and I roam with the heart of a violin
Don't violate my patience, I'm waiting, to kill a man
As I stare at the ceiling fan, as a fan of these wicked streets
If I gotta eat, I steal/steel like a metal piece
I'm screaming out, fuck the police, I'm dealing my cards with jokers on 'em
You can disown him or stone him, I'm throwing them rocks back
with the fury of bullets, you couldn't live your life for the moment
when I'm foaming at the mouth and my sharpest of teeth showing
I'm in the back of a black Buick, finna black out
like February, ain't that's how blacks do it, right?
I cut off my ears before I hear your advice and vice versa
I'm screaming for help as loud as I can, but that's not working
I'm working them corners like blueprints, then caught an L on my first offence
The judge threw the book at me, then said this

[Chorus 2X]</pre>

--- Really Be ---
Artist: YG f/ Kendrick Lamar
Album:  My Krazy Life
Song:   Really Be (Smokin' N Drinkin')
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: YG]
I woke up this morning, I had a boner
I went to sleep last night with no bitch, nigga, I was a loner
I be going through shit, losin' bitches and homies
If I don't make it with this rap shit, nigga, I might be homeless
My moms don't got a job, my pop's checks ain't enough
If ain't bringin' home that money, my whole family is fucked
I swear I move like the mob, I'm watchin' movies too much
If niggas want it, you're dead, what would you suggest?
They wonder why I do drugs and hang with thugs
Since I made it the city hated, wait, where is the love?
I ride around with my gun, this is not for fun
I stay protected cause my homie just took one to the lung
Had him on life support, where's the family support?
He knew who shot him, but he ain't even show up in court
Yeah, that's a real G, nigga, he on a kill spree, nigga
The homie popped him so I hope he don't kill me, nigga

[Chorus x2: YG]
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be going through some things, you don't know what I've been thinkin'

[Verse 2: YG]
Now I'm ridin' through traffic with 2Pac blastin'
With a bitch that's irritatin' from all these questions she askin'
Like what bitches I fucked, when, how and where
You ain't my main bitch so why the fuck do you care
That's why bitches get fucked, then turn around and get left
Somebody need to teach them less talk, more sex
I'm pressed when I'm stressed, my granny tell me I'm blessed
Well, why the fuck do Jesus Christ got me goin' through this shit?
Everybody need favors, what happens if I go broke?
Or say I ain't got it, then buy my lolo some new spokes
Right up in your fake setup, fuck you up like some mace
So fuck your handout, give a young nigga some space
Give a nigga some Ace, give me a blunt that's laced
Sprinkle some molly in it, watch me take this shit to my face
The snitch is the shooter, they took time away from his case
Holy shit, oh lawd, where is the world today?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I smoke this industry shit, to me it's one big ass lick
I walk inside of a buildin', tell the A&R nigga strip
Tell 'em I need all of my chips, my life been known Section 8
I've been a welfare case, AFDC pump fake
Meanwhile I'm grindin' cause drug money ain't like rap money
Four white kilo snow bunny, equal one whole show, dummy
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up, I got a bad call, they killed Braze
They killed Chad my big homie Pup
Puppy eyes in my face, bro, and I've really been drinkin'
Why the fuck I've really been smokin'?
What the fuck, I'm the sober one
When I'm so stressed out I can't focus
Hideout when I ride out, ski mask with the eyes out
Speed past in the Cut-lass-me and little Ocho
And we young nigga hop out
2 tears in a bucket, I feel like fuck it
That's the price of fame, recognize my pain, that's all I know
All alone, but I'm out here though
Call my troops like vamonos
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, and it's all bad
Of OG with my OG and some OE, but the tall glass

[Chorus]

Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Young Jeezy]
Yeah, what! {Mustard on the beat ho~!}

R.I.P, it's the remix killer 
Mike Jack was alive, I'd remix "Thriller" (yeeeah)
Trap star, bitch, spell it with a big T (T)
Give a damn if I never be a hot MC (Ha-haaa)
Cause I'm a hood nigga, first on everybody's list (YEAH)
Buy the whole club P, don't fuck with no Cris (daaamn)
That average ass watch can't fuck with my wrist (nope)
Them average ass hoes can't fuck with my bitch (nah)
To the window, to the motherfuckin' wall (wall)
Enough money in my jeans to buy a motherfuckin' mall (It's Tha World, nigga))
Got the choppas in the back, bulletproof, that's my Hummer
R.I.P. to the competition, this is my summer (let's go!)

[Y.G.]
YG FO' HUNNID~!
R.I.P, I wanna kill the judge (judge)
Tryna lock the homie up, they don't feel the thug
I'm thirsty, but I don't give a fuck
Fuckin' with my ex cause I'm still in love
Uh, I can teach you how to fuck and how to stack money
I ain't went Hollywood, you just act funny
But I know you want this pipe like a crack bummy
Stop playin', I'm tryna hit like a crash dummy
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit

[Young Jeezy]
I can't take yo bitch if I don't see yo bitch (nah)
We done seen that snow, Nat Geo bitch (Ha-haaa)
Cancel her and get another like I'm Nino bitch (let's go!)

[Chorus 2X: Young Jeezy]
R.I.P. (yeah) R.I.P. (yeah)
R.I.P. (yeah) R.I.P (what)
R.I.P., we just killed the club
Took patron to the head, almost killed a thug

[Kendrick Lamar]
Turnt up in this bitch and I'm beamin' and shit
Hundred hoes, hundred fold, this my season and shit
Stomach on belly roll, bitch I'm eatin' and shit
You a vegan and shit, get off my penis and shit
Look a bad bitch, I back that bitch nigga back back
Pull it out the grab bag, turn this ho to Baghdad
Bags on my eyes, I don't sleep much, we up
Bitch I beat the beat up, the homies get you beat up
And R.I.P to P-Nut, Little Eric, get back
Mausberg, 4 Bent, Compton I live that
Long hair weave with exten-sions
Glock 17 with exten-sion
Bumpin' Suga Free in the automatic dually
T.V.'s in it like it's '97, watch a porno movie
Holla Chitty Chitty Bang, this is Com-Town gang
Fuck whoever don't like it, lil' K-Dot be the name, bitch

[Chorus]

[Chris Brown]
Look, R-R-R.I.P. to the V.I.P
I got my lil' niggas in the club, fuck I.D
My niggas kill at will, give you black eyed peas
And the molly make the white girl look Chinese
Okay, O.H.B., my niggas out here ballin'
And all these fake ass artists, y'all niggas out here drawin'
Ok now dearly departed I bought a plane, I departed
And if you started from the bottom gon' head and come out the closet
You problematic, I bought them ratchets and automatics
Clip hold 32, I make you feel the Magic
You gon' see the flashes, like you in a pageant
All black suits, and them long Caddys

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
